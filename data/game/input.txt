I'm in love it's a beautiful day
I'm in love it's a beautiful way
I don't care what the weathermen say
It's a beautiful day (West side)
I'm in love it's a beautiful day (We the future)
I'm in love it's a beautiful way (We the future)
I dont care what the weathermen say (We the future)
It's a beautiful day
I'm free as a mother fucking bird I swear
Dissappearantly in air
There go game nigga where
Hosted on the block
In the black ass
In that all black phantom hug a block like a bear
Yeah That V12 is roaring
Flying through the city with the pedal to the floor and
I'm putting 26 inches on the curve
Tell the hood I'm back
Give me the Quarter and let me serve,
Swab, I'm still dope that's my word
All I did was wished the kitches and some track all on a bird
Eerb, Goddy u know I'm a murderer
Half these niggas beefing with me
I never heard of them
If I was the old me I would murdered them
In matter of face if I was the old me I would hurt him still
Courtesy, um a sleep-in west in
I kill trash like AIDS nigga get affect
I'm in love it's a beautiful day
I'm in love it's a beautiful way
I don't care what the weathermen say
It's a beautiful day
I'm in love it's a beautiful day
I'm in love it's a beautiful way
I dont care what the weathermen say
It's a beautiful day
The dream of Hougie Newton that's what I'm living through
The dream of Eric White that's what I'm giving you
Who walked through the White House without a buisness suit
Compton hand Jerry Curl tripping around a waiting shoes
Gave Mike all my demo came here to pay my deuce
Started off with who can
Then I start blazing blue
It was all a dream like Big said it be
Don't sleep on me homie I bring nightmares to reality
Rap phenomenon define the rules of gravity
Studied off classic start revising my strategy
Cause Marshal Matthers made it
Curtis Jackson made the hell
And the clouds wonderin' where the hell Marvin Gabe went
How do I say this I'm living for my son
But I can't figure out why I'm at my temple with this gun
Wake up to a Jesus piece like a Catholic nun
To war to be a rap legend has just begun (begun)
I'm in love it's a beautiful day
I'm in love it's a beautiful way
I don't care what the weathermen say
It's a beautiful day
I'm in love it's a beautiful day
I'm in love it's a beautiful way
I dont care what the weathermen say
It's a beautiful day
[Diddy talking]
I remember the first time I seen you moonwalk,
I believed I could do anything,
you made the world dance,
you made the music come to life
[Chris Brown - Chorus]
This the type of song that make the angels cry,
I look up in the sky and I wonder why?
why you had to go, go
I know it's better on the other side,
you were chosen from the start
never gon let you go,
[The Game]
Whose Michael Jackson?
You're Michael Jackson,
I'm Michael Jackson,
We all Michael Jackson,
I guess what I'm asking is, everybody bow their head for a legend,
don't breathe for a second,
now let the air out, grab the hand of somebody you care about,
so you can hear my message, my confession, someone tell Usher,
I seen the moonwalk, I guess the young thriller touched him,
like he touched me, like he touched you,
so carry on his legacy, something i must do,
and I trust you lighting candles, concrete visuals,
me and my brothers listen to Jackson 5 in the living room,
first thing i did when i heard was call puff,
cos him and Mike tried to stop the beef between us,
who was us? Me and fifty, that beef is dead,
him and Mike Jackson gonna take us to the ledge.
[Chris Brown - Chorus]
This the type of song that make the angels cry,
I look up in the sky and i wonder why?
why you had to go, go
I know it's better on the other side,
you were chosen from the start
never gon let you go,
As I'm pouring out this liquor candles start to flicker,
when list my air ones, MJ was my nigger.
Not the one that play ball, the one with the hollywood star,
and since I'm a Hollywood star Imma tell you my story,
never had a family that close,
never see Berry Gordy walking through Interscope,
but just like me, they always had Mike in a scope,
no matter what you say,
imma love him and hes still dope,
let me take you back to '85 when i was in a zone,
dancing for my momma, 'Thriller' jacket with all the zippers on,
now im doing 90 bout to crash in this Aston,
listening to Outcast, I'm sorry Mrs Jackson
anything I can ever do to better you your son was our king
so we wont Corretta you,
I'm writing this letter to all the Jackson kids, we all Jackson kids,
time to let us through.
[Chris Brown - Chorus]
This the type of song that make the angels cry,
I look up in the sky and i wonder why?
why you had to go, go
I know it's better on the other side,
you were chosen from the start
never gon let you go,
[Boys II Men]
This the kind of song that make the angels cry,
look up in the sky and ask God, why o why why
Do we live and let die
This the kind of song that make the angels cry,
look up in the sky and ask God, why o why why
Do we live and let, live and let die.
[Chorus]
Been holdin' this pain inside for so long
Though the rain never goes away
They say I should leave these streets behind me
But it's so hard to escape
Oh lord please send me an angel
To lead me out of this place
Take me awwaaayyyy
Away, far away to better days
[Verse 1]
First thing I want to do is say what up to T.I.
King of the south now everybody see why
I'm just driving and thinking how I survived here
And I ain't seen Dre and Eminem in five years
That sounds Shady right, I live a crazy life
So many black thoughts I had to paint the mercedes white
I could tell you about the rims but I ain't here for that
Goin' out like Big and Pac I fear for that
Take this lambo and put six holes in it
Shatter the glass and leave my body exposed in it
Lift the doors up and let all my demons out
And I can see my brother now cause that's what I've been dreamin' bout
I ain't thinking bout bitches and pulling beamers out
I'm thinking about my sons safety everytime they leave the house
I know how to make it out the hood, I've seen the route
And heres the proof, me, Venus and Serina out
[Chorus]
Been holdin' this pain inside for so long
Though the rain never goes away
They say I should leave these streets behind me
But it's so hard to escape
Oh lord please send me an angel
To lead me out of this place
Take me awwaaayyyy
Away, far away to better days
[Verse 2]
I'm sitting on these stairs at this church bout to start a verse
And somewhere in the world somebody bout to start a hearse
Tell me who inside it, who son is that
And how he get there now tell me who gun was that
I ain't saying confessed definetely ain't saying snitch
But if you killed the nigga, help his mamma dig his ditch
I'm from a hood were niggas gotta keep there gun cocked
And kids were Dre beats to stop the sound of gunshots
But at least they got the Dre beats
Cause kids in africa ain't even got shoes on they feet
And I've seen it with my own eyes
At the same time I'm picking flies off my own eyes
Can you feel that, if you can hear them buzzing
You can feel the pain in Mike Tyson and his baby mother
They lost their baby daughter and she was only three
She never got a chance to blossom on the family tree
[Chorus]
Been holdin' this pain inside for so long
Though the rain never goes away
They say I should leave these streets behind me
But it's so hard to escape
Oh lord please send me an angel
To lead me out of this place
Take me awwaaayyyy
Away, far away to better days
[Verse 3]
We got a new president and I love that he black
But I'm a ask him like Bush, were the soldiers at?
Now move the camera to New Orleans were the soldiers at
The water dried up well nigga do you know your clap
We all juveniles, we all been through some trials
And some tribulations, I'm in this booth pacin'
What do I say next should I talk about some cars
Or the next chapter of my life and show you all my scars
Or my bullet wounds, and my stab wounds
I can't show you I covered 'em up with tattoos
I can't do nothing but spit the truth
On probation smoking, drink patron before I hit the booth
You makin' songs for the club when niggas drinking
I'm make 'em for the ride home, when niggas thinking
One minute you here, next minute shit is tragic
And this a Jim Jonsin track now feel the static
[Chorus]
Been holdin' this pain inside for so long
Though the rain never goes away
They say I should leave these streets behind me
But it's so hard to escape
Oh lord please send me an angel
To lead me out of this place
Take me awwaaayyyy
Away, far away to better days
Play With My Cards
here we go,
bait and reel
my my aloha
gone and left the feel
just a stone throw away
just the closest of the daze
oh what a day of days
my mind works its own matrix
well it is actually a web
every moment with a connection
flashes right back in again
here we show
carrots and stew
flamenco
stars shine in the night
the firmament firm mist
mmm the closest of the day
oh what a day of daze
my mind works its own matrix
well it is certainly a web
each memory links a connection
lightspeeds my thunder in
here we know
buttons and ties
contention
inspires me for words
letters you've already heard
on the closet of daze
oh what a day of days
my mind flashes its matrix
tightening the weave of a web
gossamer strands of a oneness
this game that starts in your head.
here we blow
the man up
with reservoirs
drops upon drops
of sweet and succulent energy
oh oh closest of days
oh what day of daze
my mind bends at the matrix
triangulation to feed the web
angles shifting together
future flashes in your bed.
here we sow
seeds of growth
generations
ancestral pods
of living color
yes closest of days
oh what a day of daisy
N-gga pop tags, I pop the fo-five
N-gga got swag, I got the Tech-9
N-ggas got cash better run it
Only dubs and hundreds, I dont do fifties, n-gga
And I dont do 50-year-old Jiggas
Off that boss black Lamborghini, interior soft crack
Louis V golf hat, feelin like a Tiger
I made something out of nothin like MacGuyver
Started from an eighth, flipped it to a key
I got em like ay, trappin like Gucci
Plus I get more green than blue cheese
And I keep a red bandana in my blue jeans
So, n-gga calm your nerves, with all that absurd
Far from the curb bullshit-slash-spoken word
You nerd
Im from the same city as Venus and Serena
So dont get served
Im so wavy, homie no yacht
Aint no Big Pimpin on my block
But Im an underground king, peace to Pimp C
Catch me ridin through the hood, 20-10 Bentley
yeah You got cheese and I kill rats
Translation, I still trap
Now do something with that
Or respond to this
And with them big ass lips
You got my name in your mouth
I hope it tastes like thisahhh
No homo, one more timeahhh
Thats your promo
And I been hard to the core since I went solo
Only man on my horse like my all-black Polo
And where Im bout to go is usually a no-no
But Im loco, got the camel in a chokehold
Tryna son me, Im not from NYC
You cant even have a child by your Destiny
And I aint mean to that a shot at Bey
Im blacked out like you did Free
Cause Im so wavy
Too hardcore to be a Jay-Z
Rock more red than Weezy Baby
Please say the Baby
I been around for years, so b-tch, dont Drake me
And this is not a diss
Cause I was just out in LA with Drake, b*tch
And no disrespect to G and Hip-Hop
But n*gga Im a G and Im doing this for hip-hop
And thats Yes brother, and Ye my n-gga so
Ima give him some advice, Get rid of Amber Rose!
Ima tell you how she get down
I was at Diddys after party, sippin Cris
She was whisperin to Chris Brown
I seen Chris turn his head like No!
Then Gold Digger came on, I pointed like, Hoe!
But this aint bout her, this about Hov
Ima chop down the Roc and take it to the stove
I apologize to Bey, cause this about Hov
Ima chop down the Roc and take it to the stove
D.O.A.? No!
T-Pain stays, old n-gga goes
Im so wavy
Too hardcore to be a Jay-Z
All in your ear just like Dre beats
The ni-ga the cut yay couldnt fade me
You took a shot and the sh-t grazed me
I wet up your block just like the Navy
Put a label on the sh*t and write Play Me
DJs go in, DJs go in

N-gga, Dame, man, thats your man. You and Dame was mans and em. You and Dame used to be tighter than giraffe p-ssy and sh-t. You know your man having financial problems and sh-t. You number one on the Forbes list, n-gga, you make 35 million and sh-t. Give a n-gga a milli or sumthing. Id give it to him myself, but sh-t, I was only #13, n-gga, on the list, way down there with Jeezy and sh-t, earned 7 million this year so far. But Im on tour, n-gga, Lamborghini Tour, live from Switzerland, I gets it in. Sh-t, I could use 28 more million. But I wouldnt trade shots with you on the motherf-ckin list for that nose and them lips, n-gga. My n-gga Jay.
And last but not least, peace to M.I.A., cause the Roc bout to be MIA. No one on the corner got a swagger like you, cause no one on the f*ckin corner is 42.

on da court in new jersey,
tangled up inside the nets,

start chasing the bucks and you can bypass the moon like a rocket,
everything in pocket,
v12 whistling, chromed out engine,
oiled up pistons, rough around the edge,
who got the clippers, they do my fade magic,
like washington wizards,
so drop the top and spread my wings like a hawk,
nuggets in my ears spin the spurs when they walk,
one thing about me, never been all talk,
finish around a basket, half man, half maverick, yeah

Call 911, nobody pick up, pick, cuz the goverment dont care about
Niggas, Niggas.
An the hood turn niggas to cop killers, killers
We come through ridin' on them three wheelas, wheelas
It's kill or be killed in my village, village
For the love of the money, them cat pillars, pillars
We run trough your hood like godzilla, godzilla
With guns big enough to kill gorilla, gorilla.
In the club we shinin'
Vivi es' diamonds,and we still bad boys like Mary o' Winders
We hotter than a fucking chinchilla, chilla
We strapped but don't tell it to the squealer, squealer
Them kingston gangstas don't fill up, fill up
Snitch boys get buck 50, and the grillem', grillem'
Chorus

Coralian is the ultimate high, who gon' stop shottas, the gun datters
They give me one more chance like BIG Poppa, to make it hotter
But who's hotter than a rude boy that flow a rasta... farian
Me and my entourage walk up in the party and smoke that bitch out like a Ducati and I'm that nigga that pull triggers like treasures.
I push your blood klaat head, for that fucking Rolex.
Then past the millimeter to left front side
Rude boys never die, we multiply.
Me and Damian Marley, Wyclef and the Fugee army
(Pick up, pick up the bad man there)
Twentytwo bullets, but not lettin' into England
Niggers starting to singing, drama what we bring them
We money makers, no time for the haters
Cuz hustla in Jamacia, right in Jamaica
Bullet, Bullet. Don't pull it if u ain't gonna use it, bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet.
Bullet, Bullet. Don't pull it if u ain't gonna use it, bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet.

We Are The Champions Lyrics
I am the champion my friend
And I'll keep on fighting 'till the end
I am the champion
I am the champion
Don't end for loser 'cause I am the champion
[The Game]
Guess who's back in a son of a bitch
Underground king with a gun on his hip
Not the UGK like bun be	and pimp see
But I gotta go shoot a bucket in my bently
Ain't shit changed with the guts in a range
And no more Lloyd Banks,Tony Yayo and Young Buck in my lane
I'm a hood nigga for real mothafuck the fame
Nigga I'ma get mine
You can hate it or love it but it's a thin line
Between G Unot and G Unit
Nigga talk shit catch one in the hip
Fuck beefin the rhyme
50 forgot about his but I took mine
I showed you all 5 but he never took 9
He rap like Trina blah blah blah
Ok, shut up
Let us see the wound
Show it to the world
He got shot in the mouth and cried like a girl
You cried like a girl
And I gangbang so hard it'll bring back curls
I'm tellin' your fan don't believe that shit
Tryna beef with The Game like he that sick
You movie was trash and I went to see that shit
With a camera and got it on DVD that quick
Chicken Little and Harry Potter
The bootleg hell yeah we got 'em
Two movies 15 dollars with no numbers on the bottom
Hahahahahahaha.........
Chicken Little ghetto pimp!
I am the champion my friend
And I'll keep on fighting 'till the end
I am the champion
I am the champion
Don't end for loser 'cause I am the champion
Of the world, yeah!
Part the Red Sea in red Louboutins, who the don?
Walk inside the club with all this Gucci on, you've been warned
Packing heat like two LeBrons
And my crew is strong as Cali kush
It keep you (higher than heaven's arms)
Gucci in my closet, pardon my head
Pardon my French, but I'm on my Nas shit, off with your head
Off with your bitch, she offered me head, I offered her dick
Slid my black card at the reception, now we off in the Ritz
I'm rolling this kush, she coughing and shit
Freak bitch named Jada love the LOX, I got her talkin' to Kiss
Got my hands behind my head, now she all in the splits
Dick must be good ''cause now she in Boston with bricks
Got a text on my iPhone, she caught with my shit
Off with a ten, she took it ''cause she's far from a snitch
Hold her mama and her daddy down, got a sister at Georgetown
Paying her tuition so she ain't gotta be strippin'
It's money so I ain't trippin', this bullshit get printed
Them banks get scoped out, black cars get rented
My Gucci suit tailored, my fade get tapered
You get sent to your maker, fuckin' around with my paper, 'cause I
Part the Red Sea in red Louboutins, who the don?
Walk inside the club with all this Gucci on, you've been warned
Packing heat like two LeBrons
And my crew is strong as Cali kush
It keep you (higher than heaven's arms)
Hard bottom Ferragamos, IQ too much for mediocre convo
I know a Farrakhan though, three-story condo
IPod shuffling between Common, Jay Electronica and Bono
Armado, the last words of Paul Castellano
Nothin' but endless paper and bitches for niggas I know
Smokin' Cheeba, feeding divas McDonald's
All the way in Milano, ashin' out Cohibas
Fuckin' in that blue Aventador, the nose like Gonzo
Let a bitch get a breather, then she back hittin' high notes
Throwin' Louis luggage at dealerships, fuck a car note
15's in everything, beating like Harpo
Rolling purple like Harpo, bitches by the car load
They wana see Prince, I'm pulling strings like Carlos
Santana, now we in Magic, Atlanta
Wipin' Ciroc off my Loubi's with my Gucci bandana, 'cause I
Part the Red Sea in red Louboutins, who the don?
Walk inside the club with all this Gucci on, you've been warned
Packing heat like two LeBrons
And my crew is strong as Cali kush
It keep you (higher than heaven's arms)
Kanye with Kim now, I'm happy for that nigga
Disrespect him or his wifey, I'll slap you for that nigga
Grew up listenin' to Pac, now I'm rappin' for that nigga
My brother been dead 20 years, I'm trappin' for that nigga
God Flow like Pusha n 'em, rose Phantom pushin' 'em
Splittin' Louisville Sluggers open, puttin' kush in 'em
Ain't forgot about the Twin Towers, I blame Bush for them
Obama can't speak on it ''cause the government's shushin' him
But that's my nigga though, still stackin' figures
So one day I'm top 5 and I can politic with Jigga though
I was just trying to Blueprint myself behind Jigga, though
And all them old disses, yo, bullshit, Thibodeau
He be where the Summer be, I be where the Winter go
Tomahawk the Bugatti, Florida State Seminole
I'm out here tryna win a penant though
Never thought I'd be legendary, but fuck it I'm in it so
Part the Red Sea in red Louboutins, who the don?
Walk inside the club with all this Gucci on, you've been warned
Packing heat like two LeBrons
And my crew is strong as Cali kush
It keep you (higher than heaven's arms)
You got them funny ass colors on, take it off
If you in the club with ice on we takin' off
I thought you was a gangsta nigga, you better shake it off
What?
Sh-Sh-Shake it off, or get banged on
Gettin' my bang on, red strings on
Luis Vuitton kicks, Luis Vuitton frames on
Luis Vuitton belt holdin' the fo'-five
You know who I am bitch, I'm Mr. Westside
This West West or nothin' - get your pistols, get your flag
Gangstas we love to sag, we cock it back and blast
Like booyaka-booyaka, we lay the party down
G-G-Game, Dogg Pound
Everybody get down
Look nigga, I nurture and breed
I ain't never gave a fuck about a bitches needs
And bitch niggaz try to invade our town
I'ma lay 'em down, spray the 'K and get out
Say goodbye to the '6-4, hello to the '6-trey
He ain't never seen hydraulics, look at his bitch face
Up, down - now watch my shit scrape
Daz call Snoop, I'ma Crip Walk to get Dre
And Blood Bounce back, heat on the track
Dribble rock like Wade and bounce like Shaq
Throw a O in the pot and watch it bounce right back
Like that (like that?) like that
You got them funny ass colors on, take it off
If you in the club with ice on we takin' off
I thought you was a gangsta nigga, you better shake it off
What?
Sh-Sh-Shake it off, or get banged on
We street connected, respected, I gets pathetic
When I did it I must admit it, so nigga go and rep it
Lil' homies around her constantly on smash mode
Lil' niggaz with pistols that blowin' out your asshole
Bang how we give it, the culture that we live in
Fresh out the hospital or fresh out the prison
Real niggaz for life, the roots of the G tree
N.W.A., Dr. D-R-E
We not S-T-A-R's, we don't put stars in our shoes
Bitch we put the whole car on the shoes
You don't wanna see my car on the news
I'll "Set It Off" like Queen Latifah, red beam on the nina
Bang out, chippin' in traffic, dippin' the classic
Dippin' to classics, whoopin' that ass
It's hood niggaz ready to get it, your bitch can get it
Cause I know she'll suck a dick in less than a minute
'Cause, I'ma have to show him where the house at
Two milli macks, semi-automatic situational attack
In the back with a sack, Cadillac all black
Like this and like that
Bang, broken like glass and plastic
Bang out on him with the mask and plastic
We got access to massive plastiques
Purchased last week, D.P.G.C.
Bang
You got them funny ass colors on, take it off
If you in the club with ice on we takin' off
I thought you was a gangsta nigga, you better shake it off
What?
Sh-Sh-Shake it off, or get banged on

(What up 'cause? They don't even know what 2Pac first album was)
Should I tell 'em Blood? (Nah, fuck 'em loc)

(Dash, brake, bounce and scrape)
Run up on the '6-4, see the AK's
(Bang) like Eazy, (Bang) like Dre
(Bang) like Snoop, (Bang) in L.A.
(Bang) like Crips and Bloods
From now on, wear a Bathing Ape hoodie get stripped in the club
Like a bitch in the club, watch him strip in the club
You like ice creams? Get a banana split in the club
No jewelry, you can't wear shit in the club
And that go for every nigga and bitch in the club
So you better take it off 'fore you get in the club
Game and Dogg Pound along side sittin' on dubs
Remember that
You got them funny ass colors on, take it off
If you in the club with ice on we takin' off
I thought you was a gangsta nigga, you better shake it off

Cold streets, Telly Mac keep the guns on 'em
They wanna know how that nigga from California
Could run up on ya on any corner
Put somethin' on ya
How I stuff bricks in the 6, with no crack aroma
Dawg, I'm just livin' for the moment
I'm from Compton homey, but I'm like a center for Milwaukee
'Cause I plays for the bucks and I keep the 40 on me
Gotta keep the chrome-y, gotta keep my back to the wall
Wait for Q to rock me up, like cavi dawg
Speakin' of lle', I put 8 in, 10 jump back hard
And watch my money come back like Jordan in charge
I'm like the black Yankees, they don't want me around no more
'Cause I hold the record for the most fiends roamin' the boulevard
And when I'm on the boulevard, catch me behind the wheel
Of that new Escalade with the Foreman grill
Steppin' out of Chevies with heat that's heavy, that's president
Bullets flyin' for them dead guys, that's president
Lead meltin' inside your wig, that's president
20's 50's and 100's burnin', it's all president
Steppin' out of Chevies with heat that's heavy, that's president
Bullets flyin' for them dead guys, that's president
Lead meltin' inside your wig, that's president
20's 50's and 100's burnin', it's all president
Aiyyo, I do this shit from Compton to the Mac block
High-tech collaborations with the Gamblaz and Black Sox
Drillin' 'em, killin 'em, if we ain't feelin' 'em nigga
If sticky Fingaz need some music, straight stealin' it nigga
Shinin' in big trucks, big will in it nigga
We climbin' to the top and we sealin' it nigga
So back the fuck up, my niggaz act the fuck up
So keep yourself in line or you could get smacked the fuck up
Jacked the fuck up, beat up bad and clapped the fuck up
Wrapped up in white sheets and threw in a white truck
Over presidents, now you willin' to give your life up?
Put your kids on the line and give your wife up?
Over presidents, they got you soulless
So take this bomb and hold this, while we control this
For the streets, we comin' with heat that's stolen
And we hustle universal, for that paper that we foldin'
Roll in 600's, Beamers and 'llacs
We a team of cats with the Benz and gats
That fiend for jacks but only when the green's attached
We fiend for jacks but only when the green's attached
Steppin' out of Chevies with heat that's heavy, that's president
Bullets flyin' for them dead guys, that's president
Lead meltin' inside your wig, that's president
20's 50's and 100's burnin', it's all president
Steppin' out of Chevies with heat that's heavy, that's president
Bullets flyin' for them dead guys, that's president
Lead meltin' inside your wig, that's president
20's 50's and 100's burnin', it's all president
It's Telly and young game the hustler, ho juggler, coke smuggler
No matter what the hustle, dough doublin'
Ya or the rock, give me a day and a spot
And I bet I'll come back with 10K in the drop
I'll stay in the spot, wearin' a crop and coppin' ounces
Telly Mac and Game the hustler, we rock the house
And plus we the reason that the blocks is out
So my words to the wise is just watch your mouth
And you don't want it when the stainless out
What the game about, the bullets is in, your brains is out
All over Frisco and Compton dawg, we ruthless
And the truth is y'all niggaz can't stop us dawg
So why the fuck you wanna knock us off?
Like we some high-powered cowards
And y'all really the niggaz that's soft
Still across the train tracks, we turn 'caine crack
It's Telly Mac and Game the hustler, you can't change that
Steppin' out of Chevies with heat that's heavy, that's president
Bullets flyin' for them dead guys, that's president
Lead meltin' inside your wig, that's president

Bullets flyin' for them dead guys, that's president
Lead meltin' inside your wig, that's president
20's 50's and 100's burnin', it's all president
A lot of people are advocated
That the rich gets richer and the poor gets poorer.
That's only because you don't understand
Whats going to happen to you,
You see its all just a game ladies and gentlemen,
And the quality of your living depends entirely
Upon your ability to play the game,
And I play the game
Uhh, uhh, gangsta gangsta yeah
Uhh, uhh, it's gangsta gangsta yeah
Uhh, uhh, shit I'm livin' gangsta gangsta shit
Yeah
[Chorus: x2]
I'm from Compton, Compton, Murderville
You heard these niggas is gangsters, and they kill
Rob and steal, my niggas will peel at will
For real they real, niggas goin' feel this steel
Walk with me through the ghetto where the packs get sold
And them niggas sellin' the work ain't half as old
as the fiends and the hippies, same ones smokin' since the 60's
Everybody yellin' gimme, gimme
Every nigga in the hood, one hand on his jimmy
Other hand grip the semi, come on walk with me
Every ten houses, one got 'caine for sale
And I give you a dope track like my name Phar-rell
And you can get that stainless steel
Walk in my Chuck Taylors for a day, if you think it ain't f'real
When I buy rocks homey baguettes on my ring
And only neighborhood watch is my Tecno Marine
Keep a (Mac) on the block, I ain't talkin 'bout Beans
QB in the hood and I'm far from Queens
The boys in the hood is always hard
So come through and get smoked like a Cuban cigar
[Chorus]
I'm from Compton, Compton, a block from hell
And you can come get a bird for eleven
And we ain't got a penny for the reverend, a dime for a witness
Only (Church's) in the hood sell chicken (ba-KAW)
Every nigga in the hood sell chickens move work like city buses
You fuckin' with the Hub City Hustler
The vans on the block won't touch us, the streets my home
So I move weight on the block like I'm Moses Malone
Bring the guns anywhere I roam, go with the chrome
And I hit all my shots, like I'm in the A.I. zone
And mob like Al Capone through N.W.A.'s home
Homes like Ed Jones will cripple your team up
In the home of Dr. Dre, Venus and Serena
Where 14-year-olds pack ninas and drive Beamers
We ball up subpeonas, take niggas to the cleaners
And you know what I'm talkin' about if y'all seen where..
[Chorus]
We drug dealin', but niggas is squealin' (fuck you rats)
What more can I say, just kill 'em
Fuck 'em, the gun bust 'em, we just knock on wood
Now is this under-stood?
I mostly George when I whip, my supply is good
The man behind the bricks, I'm supplyin' the hood
Catch bodies like Pistol Pete passes on the wood
Benz parked by the fence, brick stashed in the hood
Top work by the inch, I bag it, it's gone
Ask Quik, we rock more than microphones
Some niggas ball, some niggas do what we do
And other niggas sing for Cash Money like TQ
The block will heat and sink you (hey dude)
Cali ain't all palm trees, purple haze and sea dude
Lose your life tryin' to get these jewels
I keep the 40 cal wrapped in chrome like R2-D2
[Chorus]
You can catch five, or catch me in the CL-5
Whatever way dog, the Game get live
Keepin' it gangsta in a P.D. city velour
Late night I'm in Dublin's and I got myself a four
The hood love me, hoodrats gotta hug me
Pop ex, spark the buba, the shit get ugly
Rock the mic anywhere and I ain't talkin' 'bout a concert dog
Talkin' 'bout ten niggaz in Converse dog
Get it crackin' like we out in the yard, and the warden's watchin'
Only difference is the whores is watchin'
Still love to see a nigga, roll up on 20's
Hop in that six-four, roll up on Bentley's like
Get it crackin' like we out in the yard and the warden's watchin'
Only difference is the whores is watchin'
Still love to see a nigga, roll up on 20's
Hop in that six-four, roll up one
Get it crackin' like we out in the yard and the warden's watchin'
Only difference is the whores is watchin'
Still love to see a nigga, roll up on 20's
Hop in that six-four, roll up on Bentley's like
I'm a gangsta bay-bee, from the CPT
Run with the Pound like I'm from DPG
If it's beef, you C-Murder like it ain't No Limit
And I represent the P like Russell Simmons
I'm a neighborhood superstar, get it, right
Got it? Good, okay
And I represent the P like Russell Simmons
I'm a neighborhood superstar, get it, right
Got it? Good, okay
It's the Black Sox and Get Low we get dough
In the Yay they pimp hoes, in Compton we six-fo'
I'm a neighborhood superstar, get it, right
Got it? Good, okay
It's the Black Sox and Get Low we get dough
In the Yay they pimp hoes, in Compton we six-fo'
I know ya, love to watch me, 'specially when I'm lookin' rocky
The trey with the broccoli with my handles on the Kawasaki
Handle my jewels with the cuff in' my shoes
AD jacket on my elbow, 50 coast the jewels
In my neighborhood I'm young Bill Gates, never shuffle the cake
So cover my face and run up in the place
I'm a superstar, dick and my chain, glass bezel and bang
80 karats on my pinky and rang
Crews buzz when you speakin' my name, 'cause I'm deep in the game
With top cool thangs and million dollar planes
I'm a maniac, young boy gone, like a young Roy Jones
You ought of my zone and ain't nobody home
In my neighborhood, produce stars, stakes is high
Now we soarin' through the spacious skies
Drop yo' body with them cakes and ride, the handle was up
Switchin' gears with the pedal and ride
I'm a neighborhood superstar, get it, right
Got it? Good, okay
It's the Black Sox and Get Low we get dough
In the Yay they pimp hoes, in Compton we six-fo'
I'm a neighborhood superstar, get it, right
Got it? Good, okay
It's the Black Sox and Get Low we get dough
In the Yay they pimp hoes, in Compton we six-fo'
I'm a shinin' star
And I gotta hit the boulevard in that new Jaguar
Why he move through traffic like that, purple haze
Ralways, the Ojays, the gangsta lean so
Please believe that I keep two G's in my jeans
Two gats in my sleeve, two rats in my Beam
X-5, mami let's ride
Weave in and out of traffic from Compton to Bed-Stuy
It's the kid from the far Westa, oh, shit
He know how to do more than flip pies
Get money like them stick up guys
Them "Ocean 11" licks got the young kid rich for life
And I talkin' 'bout a movie or George Clooney
I'm talkin' 'bout, runnin' in
Your spots with Uzis tucked in the Coogi
Dude me? Naw truly, might lose your lives
They say I've, got 2K2 covered like A.I.
I'm a neighborhood superstar, get it, right
Got it? Good, okay
It's the Black Sox and Get Low we get dough
In the Yay they pimp hoes, in Compton we six-fo'
I'm a neighborhood superstar, get it, right
Got it? Good, okay
It's the Black Sox and Get Low we get dough
In the Yay they pimp hoes, in Compton we six-fo'
[Chorus: The Game + JT]
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In the Bay, our chains hang, L.A. they can't bang
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In L.A. they havin problems, the Bay we pop collars
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In the Bay we pop hollows, L.A. they pop hollows
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In the Bay we pop bottles, L.A. they pop bottles
[JT the Bigga Figga]
They can't cop what the bricks'll cost
But we stay in the lane to maintain in the 6 to floss
Leather gloves with the tips to toss
But the money was made from conversation had to clip the boss
Smash down at the V.I.P.
Street smarts is crucial for young niggaz in the CX-3
Drop Jag with the price to pay
Cause the bags was heavy my chain swangin like a ice capade
Got the feds lookin twice this way
Cause we shuffle the P's in different places that the {?} name
Compton to Fillmoe man the game is real
When you turn 15 get your stainless steel
Whole squad been trained to kill, we official
And switch to get rich now we after the meals
Hard times got cakes for 3
When it's havin a bundle we break bread for the safe and flee nigga
[Chorus]
[The Game]
I got guns, guns, guns, guns
Guns all over the club
We in V.I.P. strapped, security know that
25 deep, guns up under the throwback
That new R. Kelly shit sound like Bobby Womack
Black Wall Street in HURR, nigga where the hoes at
We got sour diesel, three cases of Hypnotiq
And more guns than the Nickerson Projects
Niggaz don't want beef with me
Cause they know they gotta pay for talkin shit but the sheets is free
And ain't nuttin to shoot the club up
You don't want drama in this motherfucker throw them dubs up
Jacob got the wrists on chill
And N.W.A. chain glow like the memory of Ill Will
Relax your mind and let your drawers feel free
You're now rollin to the sound of the Game and JT
[Chorus]
[JT the Bigga Figga]
But you can't come with the rest of her friends
Cause you know I'm a boss and won't play cause she short on my ends
Make rounds from the back of the Benz
With the {?} that kid with frog eyes with the corners to bend
The things we go through I'm beatin ya brains
Got some homies next do' and I picked up the Game
While they knockin on the do' I get deep in ya dame
Gotta charge you a G just for speakin my name
[The Game]
I'm not eatin your chocha or payin for the coach ma
I'm a pimp like 50, the nigga to leave you broke ma
6 in the mornin, you stretchin on the sofa
Singin "Ain't No Nigga" like Foxy Brown and Hova
I fuck 'em dogstyle with Billys and Novas
With or without chaffeurs, I make 'em fuck the both of us
You know what it is, the gangster's back
And I keep my banger at where my chain hang at
I'm ghetto
[Chorus] - 2X
[Intro/Chorus - sample]
-- Don't cry [5X] don't..
-- Don't cry [5X] don't..
[The Game]
Amayah wake up baby
I know you're sleepin, but daddy's home now
Pictures gettin old, my lil' girl lookin grown now
Your moms said you're talkin on your own, walkin on your own now
Run across the kitchen floor in them baby drawers
I sent you from off tour and I miss you when I was tourin
Smilin at them baby pictures, so happy, tears pourin
God how can somethin so beautiful come from me?
After the gunshots thought you was done with me
But I know I'm livin now, why you made me put the guns down
Pick up the mic, start rappin for a living now
My sun, my moon, my starts, my earth
My wind, my fire, my life, my bay-bay
Tryin to make your moms life ya must be crazy, fussin and fightin
I know she love me cause ya look just like me
Day you came into this world I was so excited
Eleven twenty-one double-zero, my baby girl is here
[Chorus]
[Blue Chip]
Yo, yo, you see this rap shit I do it for you
And the first time I heard your voice I prayed to God it had to be true
Got a son now, cuttin the game, stoppin the bullshit
Remember eyein your enemy, can you pull quick
Dipped out Cali, came back, snatched my son
my girl moms and I moved out Maui
Yeah your pops gone bananas, seen wild went hard
Bigger house, wider yard, nappy with the crash bar
Off that hersh', shit you stupid, you ain't no dad nigga
Takin your black ass to court for all you have nigga
You see me and your moms, that's another topic
Ain't no whip in this world with a price you can't cop it
Stop it, press rewind, you didn't hear me right
It's a lesson to the song, I'm tryin to steer you right
Just remember your father taught you to go hard or go home
Never sing that sad song, don't cry
[Chorus]
[The Game]
Huh daddy ain't gon' preach to you, I'ma let your moms school you
Don't let the streets fool you, streets'll do you, that's why I'm talkin to you
[Blue Chip]
Yeah, you see these niggaz out here, have you stressin by the hour
Never turn your back on your foes, them dudes cowards
[The Game]
Some days sweet, and some sour - but we gon' make it together
The world is ours, and you're my flower
[Blue Chip]
If it's ice you can get that, model chicks hit that
Never stress about the downfalls just 'bout the getback
[The Game]
And I ain't sayin sex is wrong, just make sure he strap a condom on
And never, ever do it in your mother's home
[Blue Chip]
Yeah, never call a girl a bitch, show respect, son pop ya collar
Ain't nothin free, scrape and lock every dollar
[The Game]
And I will leave you with this, my lil' angel, daddy loves you
How I'd die for you, cry for you, ride for you
[Blue Chip]
Yeah, switchin handles like you breakin a zone, candy paint Impala
On the Golden Bridge, bouncin on chrome
[Chorus]
Somebody bout to get knocked
The fucked out tonight man
You better tell your boy somethin'
You better tell him somethin'
Skip through the blueprint one bang this what's mentioned
Bleek you're one hit away but he didn't know The Game was pitchin'
Balls faster than Roger Clemens nigga you're too big for your bitches
Two gold albums and I'll make you a hitter
Might make you a little richer but don't forget the big picture
All of those make you a fag but money like Little Richard
Take your faggot ass picture put it next to Gulliany
Run you for your Roc-A-Wear fit and beat you with the Tommy
Drag your ass down to Alby Square
Call Beans, Jay, Freeway, Biggs, Dame I'll be there
Compton behind me ask Nas queens is with me
You ain't never sold crack in your life I'm takin' your fiends with me
My guns smoke like Robert Downey
Two shots and a pound he got a room in Kings County
And you might live or sit in a box
Dependin' on how long it NYPD to respond to the shot
Memph Bleek, Memph Bleek, Memph Bleek
Memph Bleek, Memph Bleek, Memph Bleek
See what the problem is too much east coast dick lickin'
And everybody tryin' to do their best 2Pac rendition
Listen they wonder how I live with 5 shots
Niggaz is hard to kill on my block
When you was in the streets comin' of age
I was in the streets pumpin' the gauge
While you was rappin' I was makin' it happen
On the block with a k
While you was with The Roc on the stage
I had rocks on the stage
On headliner for the front page we know that you front
You be on sunset doin' what? Gettin' your punk ass stunt
You gon respect us or that fo' rippin' through the vests
And you know who you are deaf nigga'll get the message
Malik or M E M P H Bleek
Fuck around and be a B I T C H sleek
'Cuz all that yappin' dude will get guns clappin' dude
And stop Memphis from rappin' dude, huh
Memph Bleek, Memph Bleek, Memph Bleek
Memph Bleek, Memph Bleek, Memph Bleek
It took me a little while but I am now understandin'
Jay fucked up in the first round when he picked olo with candy
Did olo in the second, nigga take it from me
The Roc get knocked off the bounce till you picked up beans
Add freeway to the team but move the ugly bitch
Trade the Marcy reject for Cam'ron and Lil' Chris
Now the squad 5 is live 6 man is Neef
Fans in the stand yellin' out fuck Memphis Bleek
You want beef I have your body parts all over New York
Leg in jersey arm in Brooklyn head buried in central park
You can't even borrow from New York no more like John Storch
And I ain't talkin' to him I'm talkin' to Malik
And I got a pine box for a nigga like you
Streets is talkin' how many real niggaz like you
Hit LAX remember when you come to the coast
Niggaz don't play with they lives when it comes to the toast
Memph Bleek, Memph Bleek, Memph Bleek
Memph Bleek, Memph Bleek, Memph Bleek
Drama is real, like not wakin' up
Breakin' up grounds when this patriot thrust
Your mouth is on shut, your emotions are hidden
For you to handle your business, you are more than driven
Drama is real, like not wakin' up
Breakin' up grounds when this patriot thrust
Your mouth is on shut, your emotions are hidden
For you to handle your business, you are more than driven
Drama is real, like not wakin' up
Breakin' up grounds when this patriot thrust
Your mouth is on shut, your emotions are hidden
For you to handle your business, you are more than driven
If you kill it, no more standin' on that corner like a stop sign
Every time you spotted, they call it shot time
Not at the gym but in the grim reaper's hands
You important if a bullet hits, injured your plans
This is not an adventure, but a full time duty
If you seen how niggaz hit the club, they pullin' out Uzis
Sometimes bruisin' and grazin', mostly takin'
No more sleep for the shooter, no more of hangin'
No mo' trustin' hoes, you ain't known fo' ten plus
No mo' smokin' with the homies, no mo' late night clubs
'Cuz the victim, is ready to stick him like a mousetrap
I'm 'bout to rap, you better be 'bout peepin' out cash
This is blood on my Nikes solid, murdered a nigga
The stash spot smokin', I done, murdered a nigga
San Quinn, got a hurt for the nigga, it get worser for niggaz
We take this beef shit further than niggaz
Streets are shady, they got curtains for niggaz
All of a sudden ass killers, never heard of these niggaz
Have your whole family cryin' a river, we'll murder you niggaz
We take this beef shit personal nigga
I ain't met a nigga, yet could fuck with this rap vet
I'm the realest since I came in the game on Kam back
Rest in peace to Mausberg, gotta live with that
Keep the M2 on my hip, I live with that
Eat with that, sleep with that, come get me
Four fifty, put somethin' through your son, Easter basket
Six in your truck, get you each a casket
Put termites in your box, let 'em eat your cabbage
A wife right here, see if she can weave through traffic
Everybody gotta die, when the beef is active
If you know Game, you know I'll never give free passes
But I give choices, how you want it, metal or plastic
Life is real, pedal to traffic, no spots on my tail
Cops on the payroll, show me and Quinn live well
And I can still get a nigga the hill, your bitch as well
Shotgun got mo' punks than shells
This is blood on my Nikes solid, murdered a nigga
The stash spot smokin', I done, murdered a nigga
San Quinn, got a hurt for the nigga, it get worser for niggaz
We take this beef shit further than niggaz
Streets are shady, they got curtains for niggaz
All of a sudden ass killers, never heard of these niggaz
Have your whole family cryin' a river, we'll murder you niggaz
We take this beef shit personal nigga
I see the Escalade, got 'em runnin' downhill, snowball niggaz
We throw vapors out of truck windows, blow our figures
Suede corners out the sunroof, the fifth or the Ruger
Broad daylight, blow the windows out of your Cougar
Move in the S5, plus five, leather dust fly
Spark up a dutch, Game, put niggaz in a coffin, too much
Turn niggaz kids into orphans, too much, in God we trust, nah
Keep the fifth close like Starsky and Hutch
Your daughter cryin', it's just tuck, but so what
Blow the dutch, southpaw bust out your whole fronts
Have you eatin' soup for months, broken jaw, lick your shit out of straws
I guess I got that same ol' harm
I ain't for play, this Game is raw
Specialize in death jackets, here, try these bullets on
And next time have all my cheese, 'cuz if you owe
Specialize in death jackets, here try these bullets on
And next time have all my cheese, 'cuz if you owe
Specialize in death jackets, here, try these bullets on
And next time have all my cheese, 'cuz if you owe me
Guns O U T, we all gon' squeeze
This is blood on my Nike's solid, murdered a nigga
The stash spot smokin', I done, murdered a nigga
San Quinn, got a hurt for the nigga, it get worser for niggaz
We take this beef shit further than niggaz
Streets are shady, they got curtains for niggaz
All of a sudden ass killers, never heard of these niggaz
Have your whole family cryin' a river, we'll murder you niggaz
We take this beef shit personal nigga

[19 second instrumental to open]
[The Game]
Live now, die later, flood or clock the shit out of haters
Got niggaz tryin to "Kiss the Game Goodbye" like Jada
Get your shit pushed back like Jada's CD
I'll put your brains on that Kenwood TV
So you can see hell in 3D, it's right there dog
And the Game behind the Desert is a nightmare dog
If it's pussy, I might share it dog, beef I'm right here dog
I'm on the block, white Nike Airs on
Gucci check, Coogi sweat, they wanna know
if 22's on the truck, give me coochie yet
But I come through in the new GS with two, three tecs
Got niggaz Harlem Shakin like the new G. Dep
Tryin to read my whole script, but ain't seen the movie yet
Better have that glock stuffed tonight
I'm comin through with Young Noble, and we, gon', make, it
A block bust tonight
[Chorus 2X: The Game]
Getting American Money Easy, all I know
The Gangsta All Motherfuckers Envy, all my dough
It's a West coast knot, watch, let it bang out
Shots range out, for all the gangsta hangouts
[The Game]
Lace your tips, polish your gators, we like odds in Vegas
You can't ball? Then it's probably the haters
Can't breathe then it's probably the Desert, if you a gangsta or not
I give a fuck dog, bullets is hot
And every nigga gon' cry when he hit, the more pain
the more blood drain, he ain't survivin shit
And your niggaz ain't gon' ride for shit, they know
if they came through everybody in the X-5 is hit
Red rag or blue rag, niggaz die for this
The Game the reason all these niggaz on that "Cali Love" shit
Compton niggaz get grimy too, pull you out of that 6
Fuck you up like one time'll do
And I dare y'all to stop on the 'Shaw, and King Boulevard
Comin hard, Doogie Howser pullin bullets out your jaw
Turn your round trip into a one-way ticket
You can visit, but you can not lie and kick it
[Chorus]
[Young Noble]
Aiyyo, we left a stain on your block, you came with a cop
Pointin fingers at them niggaz, that kept shit hot
Next to 'Pac, I'm the hottest thang out, homey we can bang out
Outlaw air it out, box 'em in, square it out
Learn about your whereabouts and we right there
Me and Game have you left right there
N-O-B-L-E, O-U-T-L-A-W-Z
We bubble with ease, and I double my cheese
I got niggaz out in Compton that'll find yo' ass
I got niggaz out in Jersey, that'll hide yo' ass
for a long time if you ever fuckin with mine
It's a thin line dog between the real and the fraud
We killin your squad, my homeboy still in the yard
You the type of motherfucker standin next to the God
The Game is deep, you motherfuckers ain't the streets
Young Noble and the homey Game flamin heat, c'mon
[Chorus]
Exclusively, ridin' on them deuces G
Talkin 'bout what your gameplan used to be
They got us choppin' up game through the fog and smoke
We came a long way but still we got so far to go
Exclusively, ridin' on them deuces G
Talkin 'bout what your gameplan used to be
They got us choppin' up game through the fog and smoke
We came a long way but still we got so far to go
Yeah, I know I got 4 to go, so with these bars I flow
At a pace for the papes, I thank y'all should know
I lace it properly for property, it really ain't no stoppin' me
And plus I'm tryin to get my money on like Monopoly
Politickin' economy if I could be a made nigga
Smokin' on e'ry nigga, balled out paid nigga
Keepin' it real, I'm still deep in the field
Deep with the skills for the bills
I got the million dollar mouthpiece with no gold grill
I bring the thrill like Will Clark
I will bust I will spark and flame in the booth
You blind you shoulda saw it when I came in the booth
I serve the thunder, that shit that'll bang in the roof
My niggas, stack riches, mack bitches
Blow fast swishers with my folks, act vicious with my folks
Suave livin' with my vocals, outlaw like my nigga Noble
Fuckin' bad bitches at the hotel
There's nothin' to a boss, man we live it up
Smash for the cash and respect so when we mash niggaz give it up
I got no time for that fake shit
Jersey to the Bay niggaz thuggin' even bitches thinkin' they sick
So nigga basically the world is a ghetto
Play a nigga out his scratch, he gon' be twirled in' a meadow
I keep it real with niggaz that be true to me
There's nothin' you can do to me
My crew is deep and real niggaz rule the streets
Exclusively, ridin' on them deuces G
Talkin' 'bout what your gameplan used to be
They got us choppin' up game through the fog and smoke
We came a long way but still we got so far to go
Lace your Timbs, polish your gators, we like odds in Vegas
You can't ball then it's probably the haters
Can't breathe then it's probably the desert
If you a gangster or not
I give a fuck dawg, bullets is hot
And every nigga gon' cry when he hit
The more pain the more blood drain, he ain't survivin shit
And your niggas ain't gon' ride for shit, they know
If they came through everybody in the X-5 is hit
Red rag or blue rag, niggaz die for this
The Game the reason all these niggaz on that Cali Love shit
Compton niggaz get grimy too, pull you out of that 6
Fuck you up like one time'll do
And I dare y'all to stop on the 'Shaw, and King Boulevard
Pull it hard, Doogie Howser pullin' bullets out your jaw
Turn your round trip into a one-way ticket
You can visit, but you can not lie and kick it
It's time for me to shine, life on the grind, life on the line
Feelin' like I'm runnin' out of time
It's now or never, chasin' this cheddar 'til things get better
These streets got me hungry as ever
Can't stop can't change, young Sav stuck in the game
Everyday we gotta hustle and slang, struggle and strain
To bubble, weed plus the 'caine to juggle
Organize the brains and muscle
Exclusively, ridin' on them deuces G
Talkin' 'bout what your gameplan used to be
They got us choppin' up game through the fog and smoke
We came a long way but still we got so far to go
You [unverified] like Sammy did Gotti, told 'em we kamikaze
Like those whiteboys ain't heedin the robbery
Told 'em we ride around in them cars on them big wheels
In the killin' field makin' 100 bills on the P-700 Pirelli wheels
Marshall Faulk in to ball again in this day to day scrimmage
'Bout the spinach this game is relentless where we livin'
Niggaz'll 32 round ya, kick you on the ground
After they down ya, sneak ya and plot ya, Heckler & Koch ya
Got ya body bein' scrutinized by a flock of doctors
Still an unsolved mystery, statistically, history
A Get Low nigga victory by fuckin' with my credibility
I'm from Compton where them guns bust, watch Poppa George pop
Cats tellin' jokes at them car games seen big face hundreds
Handle the rock like Nate Archibald, what? This nigga only sixteen
And I wanted to be, just like him middle school fightin'
Any nigga with a chip on his shoulder, whattup nigga?
You want beef with me? Now I let the heat speak for me
No more talkin', just outline chalkin'
Nigga witta attitude from birth, 100 Miles and Running
Gunnin' bustin' shots like fuck the cops
Notorious for burnin' blocks, weavin' in and out of traffic and chop
Game the young Robin Hood of the block
Steal from the rich, give to the poor, coward niggaz rock
Second comin' of this black Alfred Hitchcock
Kick in the door wavin' the four-four
Ten shots to your spleen
Let them violins sing
Yo, I'm just a ghetto nigga stuck in this game
Young'uns runnin' with 'caine
Rain hits so we floodin' the game
When you come to Compton respect the grounds, leave you shook man
(And I look good, from Compton to Brooklyn)
Hey yo I don't give a fuck who you are, fuck ya ice
Fuck the block that you claim, fuck your Bentley Azure
(Dead presidents is all I represent)
('Til y'all met me y'all niggaz ain't met gangsta yet)
Fast cars, money and muscle, the hustle I was brought up in the 80's
Gangbangin', dope traffic, shit get crazy
From where niggaz grow up hard like dicks raised
Them hustlin' guns like nicks players, we got mouths to feed
'Til they put flowers on me, moms kiss my cold cheek
In that pine box, I'm buyin' rocks, eyein' cops
Fuck a cell block, the young kid makin' it happen
Who you think got them fiends runnin' back like Bo Jackson?
I'm a gangsta, what else could I say?
I'm ahead of myself like it's Y4K
2Pac, Scarface, N.W.A.
Taught me how to dodge them bullets, keep my wig in play
Keep fo' snug in the waist or pay a thousand to have 'em
Niggaz in the street move faster than, Michael Jackson's album
But the shit don't really matter to me, we get better G
Bet the four slow 'em down like PCP
Yo, I'm just a ghetto nigga stuck in this game
Young'uns runnin' with 'caine
Rain hits so we floodin' the game
When you come to Compton respect the grounds, leave you shook man
(And I look good, from Compton to Brooklyn)
Hey yo I don't give a fuck who you are, fuck ya ice
Fuck the block that you claim, fuck your Bentley Azure
(Dead presidents is all I represent)
('Til y'all met me y'all niggaz ain't met gangsta yet)
Real gangsters never talk shit, handle they business
Fuck the dry snitchin' and bitchin', niggaz die when them bullets fly
Who fuckin' with him, ha? Not a nigga alive
End up dead in that 5
He got no sympathy for them dead guys, friend or foe
Watch that chest cave in, what that vest savin'?
Make it sloppy for the autopsy, leave my enemies in a frenzy
On the front lines holdin' a 9
Everyday a new chapter, my own niggaz plottin' on me
Tryin' to hit me but they won't get me
Feel the semi first fuckin' with my dough, is the worst way to go
Y'all know, niggaz cry when them bullets burn slow dummy
In and out of spots watchin' my money
If one dollar come up missin' bodies start to come up missin'
No one too heavy for the expedition, piss on your corpse
Watch your soul shiver, throw him in the river, bitch nigga
Yo, I'm just a ghetto nigga stuck in this game
Young'uns runnin' with 'caine
Rain hits so we floodin the game
When you come to Compton respect the grounds, leave you shook man
(And I look good, from Compton to Brooklyn)
Hey yo I don't give a fuck who you are, fuck ya ice
Fuck the block that you claim, fuck your Bentley Azure
(Dead presidents is all I represent)
('Til y'all met me y'all niggaz ain't met gangsta yet)
This is my home feel me

Black Rows sittin' low 22 dippin' gold bangin' Friend or Foe, feel me
Yea when from a young and dumbin'
To da second comin'
Niggas can't see in da Phantom I call them Stevie Wonder
It never rained Southern California everyday is Summa'

The Game talking]
What the fuck is all this noise?
He from Cali he can't rap
He ain't better than this nigga
That's my favorite artist
Fuck y'all hear the breakdown
[Verse 1: The Game]
No detox I'm comfortable dog
Like the solo Reeboks right up under me dog
And it feel like I done it before
Sit in the throne pollutin the airwaves like a hummer exhaust
Don't let MAKAVELI fool you homey thuggin it costs
Pour out a little liquor for the loved ones that we lost
You ain't gotta wait for the album I don't fuck with The Source
But I turn up my Eazy-E and let it bump in the Porsche
I mean turn up my B.I.G. and let it bump in the Porsche
Tell 'em to roll red carpet when he come in New York
Hip-hop police on me think they runnin New York
Till I lace my and1 show 'em how to run in New York
They tryin to take me downtown put me under the court
'cause Joe Buddens told 'em I carry a gun in New York
And homey that's strictly fact he got ripped on wax
So he snitched just to get me back
No matter what you say dog your shit be whack
You better watch what you say it might get you clapped
Here's a little advice homey switch your raps
'cause that shit on your last album ain't get you PLAQUES
What nigga you need a gun? I'll get you that
P-89 nigga let Dre stitch you back
HE AIN'T A Industry niggaz I'll admit to that
But I don't even want your chain I'll let the Crips do that
12 bars for that bitch he won't live through that
Even a nigga with a ten-year bid knew that
Put a gun in his mouth yeah, yeah do that
He a pussy (sniff, sniff) his own kid knew that
I'm Ready To Die B.I.G knew that
He ain't eatin look at his white tee you could see his ribs through that
You cocksucker let your ears do that
Or ride later do me ooh wee now back to rap
2 Lincoln continentals sittin back to back
Leavin Jersey City naw nigga Hackensack
Where's that somewhere where the crackers at
Real far from where the roaches and rats is at
Come to Compton I'll show you where the racquet's at
Down the street from the staples centers where they hack-a-shack
Give the advance money back I AIN'T have to rap
Break Harry-O out tell him crack is back
That's nine five a bird take half of that
Import it, export it in cracker jacks
When you get to the projects ask for Black
You know what you started with give him half of that
He gon give you 50 g's in a plastic sack
And I'm a give you 3500 cash for that
Gotta keep your mouth closed or I'm a blast the Mack
They won't believe you the whole world know that bastard rap
Once you outta the throne you can't have it back
Retirement home and ain't nothing after that
Except you layin in a casket black
Suit on you can't go to heaven with timberland boots on
No subliminals I ain't talkin to you Shawn
I'm talkin to that heartless mouse with no jewels on
Who the fuck put you on
Faggot ass nigga let men toss his salad like croutons
I fuck with Fab get my DJ Clue on
Sit inside Hot 97 with no tools on
And it don't matter IF it's Sway or KaySlay
Angie Martinez I'll take 'em back to k-day
They act like they forgot about Dre-day
I don't rap for Free that's why they fired AJ
It's me leaking through your stereo
Envy me AS AN emcee prepare for your burial
I kill niggaz without lettin the Desert blow
Razor tongue and I'm far from Haitian son
All black like the range rover wheels
niggaz whisper around The Game like The Game won't kill
Let me show you the stars take you back to the car
Rewind time march 3, 1994
I was only in my teen's deuce-deuce in my Levi's
When Nas hit the scene I was still rockin knee-highs
Runnin with my brother FASE he was seventeen
Two guns in the upper waist so we hit the block
Saw niggaz from a rival gang bumpin Dre
Ran up on the '64 and that's all she wrote
We runnin through the alley like Bishop chasin Raheem Ass
First murder and I did that without a mask
Fast-forward see Game gettin out a Jag
Two piece suit on he still got his rag
Gangbangin forever he still got his swag
Let me catch you in Los Angeles without a pass
Everybody in New York know that you a fag
Come out the closet show the world how to use a pad
Speakin death on my red bandana
Naw he couldn't have said that so I raised my antennas
Look at my Nextel got a call from Santana
That nigga a pussy we just saw him in Atlanta
So I hopped on the first thing smokin to Atlanta
Pulled up at 112 ran up on that black phantom
Security hopped out no Joe in here
Just Outkast gettin ready for a show in here
So I uncocked the .44 hopped in the cherry 'lo-lo
Chrome grill with the G-Unit logo
We watched Hov go now the world waitin for my solo
I'm the man Stat Quo know
I ain't gotta explain even Bo know
Have of these rap niggaz is faker than rolls gold
Get hit in the face with the back of the .44
And pissed on tryin to play The Game with a broke nose
My bitch harder than you yeah Vita loco
I haven't sold one record got rap in a chokehold
I'm Dre certified like the leader of the band
Run up you sure to die I'll leave you where you stand
Smurf-ette runnin around New York like he the man
But he peed in his pants
When he saw us at Summer Jam
Lucky I wasn't there I had to bury my man
Or I would've terrorized New York like the Son Of Sam
What you mean terrorize New York?
I mean expose these pussy ass niggaz like I'm Too Short
Somebody tell Domination I'll leave 'em in parts
leg in Jersey, arm in Brooklyn, head buried in Central Park
He can't walk through New York no more like john STARKS
Gotta call 'cause i'mma break his ankles like Hot-Sauce
Ask niggaz from your hood I'm thorough IN 5 boroughs
Sit on any stoop ? In the thermo
Wait till Alpo come home
Like AZ from Harlem Dre gon pay me regardless
'cause he know Jay-Z departed
And these other rap labels know don't feed they artists
Talkin blueprint shit you got three garages
Gettin money off Roc like little E and carter
Showin off your little chain like these is flawless
Send him 50 cent a day I can see he starvin
I got R&B; bitches givin me mnage's
Deep massages I could hear Eazy talkin
Tellin me to have a seat in Tamika's office
Buy Ruthless and get Lil' E involved in
Promote without that magazine in Boston
Take a couple mil make Beans a offer
Give him money we don't see that often
But it was all a dream like I seen Memph Bleek in Marcy
I ain't say you won't see Bleek in Marcy
I said my said he won't see Bleek in Marcy
I'm from Compton where niggaz used to bleed for BARKLEY'S
Drive lo-lo's and we ain't need keys to start 'em
Just a little information for your summer vacation
Bring your chain 'cause every nigga in L.A. waitin
Mad 'cause Detroit beat the shit out the Lakers
And they'll kill you 'cause THEY can't find Gary Payton
Meanwhile the throne vacant and Da Band ain't makin it
Shyne got a new deal, Def Jam gotta pay us
PLAYBOY Jones got knocked out shortly after they weighed him in
niggaz got beef with G-Unit but ain't sayin shit
Quiet as a church on Tuesdays
Niggaz say they hate my music but my alerts ON THEY TWO ways
Nigga I'm a hazard like Michael Jackson in khakis
Touch kids but I do that with a semi-automatic
With or without traffic I pull my shit out and blast it
I'm blind to the masses like Stevie wonder without glasses
I'm a savage spit murder like a .38 Magnum
16 bars of baggum let the hook toe tag 'em
Murder any MC throw 'em in that white wagon
Let him die and come back look at 'em he white flaggin
Spreadin rumors like when I see Game I might jack 'em
I'm tellin the world he reach for my chain I might clap 'em
'cause niggaz shot me in 2001
Took one in the heart 'cause I was too proud to run
The clip was empty when the police found my gun
So I don't bring that gangbangin shit around my son
Nigga 50 took 9 he know how it feel
And I found out Buck got shot up in CaShville
And Sha Money told me Lloyd Banks got hit
And Yayo just came home G-G-G-Unit
Backstage at a D-12 concert
A fan asked me how it feel to be walkin in Snoop's converse
Niggaz show me love when they see me in the streets
But they frown when I don't wanna hear none of they beats
Nigga this shit crazy
Em said some shit when was 16 now they tryin to RUIN Slim Shady
I forgive him I got problems of my own
How you think the streets gon' act know that Suge GOT home
These niggaz is birds I can see the feathers on 'em
If Doc give me the word I put this Berretta on EM
When the beef is on my piece is on
Them white sheets is on 'em Doc breathin on 'em
And I got an extra clip in my Reeboks
'cause I'm in and out my socks every time I see cops
Game got the streets locked call 9-1-1
Get the whole fuckin LAPD shot
Niggaz snitchin to the street cops
Get your nephews and your niece shot
With my heat cocked in the beach stop
Nigga witta attitude like I heard Dr. Dre doin Detox
Niggaz fightin for the throne that ain't shit
Tryin to measure the fallin legends but the shoe won't fit
Niggaz might think I'm ridin dick
'cause I'M AT the cemetery puttin creases in my G-Unit's
Tryin to talk TO Jesus Christ into lettin me dig 'em up
So they could stand side by side again and live it up
This might be the last time you hear me biggin 'em up
With suicidal thoughts bangin me and my bitch in the truck
My conscience tellin me if I put the clip in the buck
It might be loud enough to wake B.I.G and them up
What if that was P. Diddy sittin in the truck
And 2Pac was in jail the day HE RECORDED hit him up
I wouldn't be outside 40/40 bumpin 'Jigga What'
Wouldn't be SIGNED to Dr. Dre I wonder is its luck
They got me on MTV with Banks, Fifth, and Buck
I ain't tryin to be L.A.'s king he carry a pimp cup
[The Game talking]
Snoop Dogg got the crown nigga
What the fuck y'all mad at me for
I ain't sold one fuckin record
I'm just tryin to use these 200 bars to feed my family nigga
I ain't no threat
I can't rap I'm from Compton remember
You gotta be out your motherfuckin mind
Ask KaySlay, ask Clue, ask Whoo Kid, ask Funk Flex
I'll murder anyone of you motherfuckers
G-G-G-G-Unit
Ah!
I never said anything, I never take anything back
Well, you kinda heard me speaking
"You ain't a crisp like Snoop, you ain't a blood like Game"
And I was speaking on Game without knowing him
But now, you know a lot of these dudes jump in the game
And they rap artists and that's exactly what they is
But they not what they say they are when they rap it
[Incomprehensible]
Everybody wanna be the king of the south when
They ain't runnin' the damn thing with they mouth
No doubt, it's all good, y'all just stay in y'all opinions
But in the South and in the hood it's understood without saying
It's a given and it ain't 'cause what I'm doin' for a livin'
It's more because of what I'm doin' how I'm livin'
Not to mention when I'm rappin', I'm just hurtin' niggaz feelings
And still chillin' on somethin' that's into healing
Man, permissions from the Click to continue to keep it pimpin'
But while the crack was in the house
The record sale went through the ceiling
So say what you want and do what you please
But for fun I shoot 22's from your shoes to your knees
I run a record label and a crew of G's
So niggaz will come and look for you if you sneeze
Or even breathe the wrong way
You better do what the song say and be easy
Else it'll be a long day
I'm a king, bank rolls in the pockets of my jeans
I'm a king, you pussy niggaz couldn't see me in your dreams
I'm a king, top topic of all of your magazines
I'm a king, head of the body, leader of the team
I'm a king, remember I can get your block knocked off
I'm a king, a Bentley coupe with the top chopped off
I'm a king, I'm connectin' nationwide but in the South
I'm a king, just respect it and keep my name out 'cha mouth
Everybody wanna be the King of the West
But, they ain't runnin' the damn thing in the West
That's to bad, it's all good, they just speakin' they minds
Stand on top of the Hollywood sign, you can see that it's mine
I'd rather die, motherfucker, than give up my throne
My crown is a Dodger fitted, California's my home
And it's known when the drama pop off, I bring the chrome
So nigga leave me alone, 'fore I start living my songs
I made a killin' drug dealin', some people say I'm a villain
Went from choppin' in the house, to the top of rap gettin' millions
So watch your mouth, unless you ready to bleed
'Cause to me, murderin' wack mc's is somethin' like a disease
Top down in the Impala, so I can ride in the breeze
And where I'm from, niggaz throwin' up B's and C's
So make a turn the wrong way, think about what the song say
And be easy, else it'll be a long day
I'm a king, bank rolls in the pockets of my jeans
I'm a king, you pussy niggaz couldn't see me in your dreams
I'm a king, top topic of all of your magazines
I'm a king, head of the body, leader of the team
I'm a king, remember I can get your block knocked off
I'm a king, impala with the top knocked off
I'm a king, I'm connectin' nationwide but in the West
I'm a king, disrespect it I hit your brains with the tech
Keep your eyes off my throne and your hands off my crown
Or get your ass laid back
Keep your eyes off my throne and your hands off my crown
Or get your ass laid back
Fuckin' with Black Wall Street and Pimp Squad Click Get
Laid out like a drunk, on the late, late
So haters hate, the hell with all the hearsay
From Wednesday to Tuesday, T.I.P. act a fool, hey
I'm a king, bank rolls in the pockets of my jeans
I'm a king, you pussy niggaz couldn't see me in your dreams
I'm a king, top topic of all of your magazines
I'm a king, head of the body, leader of the team
I'm a king, remember I can get your block knocked off
I'm a king, a Bentley coupe with the top chopped off
I'm a king, I'm connectin' nationwide but in the West
I'm a king, just respect it and keep my name out 'cha mouth
I'm a king
[Eminem - talking]
I'd be a horrible mixtape DJ
I would be really fuckin bad
THIS IS MOTHERFUCKIN EMINEM!
Or just Eminem
Whatever you want to call me
And your listenin to the motherfuckin easy listenin sounds, or whatever
Clear your fuckin ear wax out
This is motherfuckin DJ Kay Slay
The Drama King and it goes a little somethin like this
Yo turn that click off, alright
(*beat to Eminem, Obie Trice & 50 Cent's "Love Me" starts*)
Look ..
[Eminem]
My music is soothin but it's also been proven
That it can put you in the mood to jump outta ya car while it's movin
You've been waitin on this moment, my sermon
Is like a omen, I'm servin, I'm Erick Sermon
I saw the window was open and I jumped through it
My shit if you don't get pumped to it
I quit, here's my rhyme book go head and thumb through it
And pick what you want from it, rummage ya find somethin
You can use to jump someone and roll up bumpin
I'm constantly coppin over you, squatin, shit is gotten
To the point, where I'm ain't even writin no more I'm just jottin
This is chicken scratch
Shit is sickin, I've been kickin ass off bullshit, throw away rhymes, pick a batch
I live for the love of rap
You crazy? I've made beats for Jay-Z for free
Page me, you need a beat
You Canibus? then it's Dre's beat
You Kay Slay? the fee's waived
I stay beefin with JD to the day Dre two-ways me
That it's ok to stop blazin him
Oops I put it out I apologize now is too late G
It's on tape and the tape leaked
"Say what you say" motherfucker
Drama King, Kay Slay motherfucker
We dictate these mixtapes motherfucker
Xzibit blaze this little gay midget cocksucker
This is how we do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This is how we do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love
This is how we do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This is how we do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love
Fresh like, Impala,
Chrome hydraulics, 808 drums
You don't want, none
Nigga better, run
When beef is on, I'll pop that, drum
Come get, some
Pistol grip, pump
If a nigga step on my white Air, Ones
Since red, rum
Ready here I, come
Compton,
Dre found me in the, slums
Sellin' that skunk, one hand on my gun
I was sellin' rocks when Master P was sayin "Unnnh"
Buck pass the blunt
These G-Unit girls just want to have, fun
Coke and rum
Got weed on the ton
I'm bangin' with my hand up her dress like,
I'll make her cum, purple haze in my lungs
Whole gang in the front in case a nigga want to, stunt
I put Lamborghini doors on that Es-co-lade
Lil pro so look like I'm riding on blades
In one year man, a nigga's so paid
I have a straight bitch in the telly goin' both ways (Ah!)
Touch me, tease me, kiss me, please me
I give it to ya just how you like it, girl
You know I'm rockin' with the best tre pound on my hip
Teflon on my chest
They say I'm no good
Cause I'm so hood
Rich folks do not want me around
Cause shit might pop off, and if shit pop off
Somebody gon' get laid the fuck out
They call me new money, say I have no class
I'm from the bottom, I came up too fast
The hell if I care, I'm just here to get my cash
Bougie ass bitches, you can kiss my ass
This is how we do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This is how we do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love
This is how we do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This is how we do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love
I put gold Daytonas on that Cherry Six-Four
White walls so clean it's like I'm ridin on bulbs
Hit one switch mang, that ass so low
Cali got niggaz in New York ridin on hundred spokes
Touch me, tease me, kiss me, please me
I give it to ya just how you like it, girl
You now rockin with the best fo' pound on my hip
Gold chain on my chest (Ah!)
50, unh
Bentley, unh
Em came 'n gotta nigga fresh out the, slum
Automatic, gun
Fuck 'em one-on-one
We wrap up ya punk ass, stunt 'n ya done
Homie, it's Game time
You ready? Here I come
Call Lloyd Banks and get this motherfucker, crunk
It took two, months
But Fifty got it done
Signed with G-unit
Had niggas like, "huh?"
Don't try to front
I'll leave yo' ass, slumped
Thinkin' I'm a punk
Get your fuckin' head, lumped
Fifty got a, gun
Ready here he come
Gotta sick, vendetta
To get this, chedda'
Meet my Ba, Retta'
The dra-ma, setta'
Sip Am-a, retta'
My flow sounds, better
Than average
On tracks I'm a savage
I damage
Any nigga tryin' to front on my clique (G-Unit!)
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In the Bay, our chains hang, L.A. they can't bang
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In L.A. they havin' problems, the Bay we pop collars
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In the Bay we pop hollows, L.A. they pop hollows
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In the Bay we pop bottles, L.A. they pop bottles
They can't cop what the bricks'll cost
But we stay in the lane to maintain in the 6 to floss
Leather gloves with the tips to toss
But the money was made from conversation had to clip the boss
Smash down at the V.I.P.
Street smarts is crucial for young niggaz in the CX-3
Drop Jag with the price to pay
'Cause the bags was heavy my chain swangin' like a ice capade
Got the feds lookin' twice this way
'Cause we shuffle the P's in different places that the [unverified] name
Compton to Fillmoe man the game is real
When you turn 15 get your stainless steel
Whole squad been trained to kill, we official
And switch to get rich now we after the meals
Hard times got cakes for 3
When it's havin' a bundle we break bread for the safe and flee nigga
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In the Bay, our chains hang, L.A. they can't bang
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In L.A. they havin' problems, the Bay we pop collars
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In the Bay we pop hollows, L.A. they pop hollows
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In the Bay we pop bottles, L.A. they pop bottles
I got guns, guns, guns, guns, guns all over the club
We in V.I.P. strapped, security know that
25 deep, guns up under the throwback
That new R. Kelly shit sound like Bobby Womack
Black Wall Street in HURR, nigga where the hoes at
We got sour diesel, three cases of Hypnotiq
And more guns than the Nickerson Projects
Niggaz don't want beef with me
'Cause they know they gotta pay for talkin' shit but the sheets is free
And ain't nuttin' to shoot the club up
You don't want drama in this motherfucker throw them dubs up
Jacob got the wrists on chill
And N.W.A. chain glow like the memory of Ill Will
Relax your mind and let your drawers feel free
You're now rollin' to the sound of the Game and JT
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In the Bay, our chains hang, L.A. they can't bang
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In L.A. they havin' problems, the Bay we pop collars
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In the Bay we pop hollows, L.A. they pop hollows
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In the Bay we pop bottles, L.A. they pop bottles
But you can't come with the rest of her friends
Cause you know I'm a boss and won't play cause she short on my ends
Make rounds from the back of the Benz
With the [unverified] that kid with frog eyes with the corners to bend
The things we go through I'm beatin' ya brains
Got some homies next do' and I picked up the Game
While they knockin' on the do' I get deep in ya dame
Gotta charge you a G just for speakin' my name
I'm not eatin' your chocha or payin' for the coach ma
I'm a pimp like 50, the nigga to leave you broke ma
6 in the mornin', you stretchin' on the sofa
Singin', "Ain't No Nigga" like Foxy Brown and Hova
I fuck 'em dogstyle with Billys and Novas
With or without chaffeurs, I make 'em fuck the both of us
You know what it is, the gangster's back
And I keep my banger at where my chain hang at
I'm ghetto
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In the Bay, our chains hang, L.A. they can't bang
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In L.A. they havin' problems, the Bay we pop collars
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In the Bay we pop hollows, L.A. they pop hollows
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In the Bay we pop bottles, L.A. they pop bottles
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In the Bay, our chains hang, L.A. they can't bang
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In L.A. they havin' problems, the Bay we pop collars

[Intrp]
They don?t seem to want me but they won?t admit
I think I?m some kind of creature that they are having fear of
Hard times
There's no love to be found
[The Game]
I?m feeling like a black Democrat,
Barack Obama but the only nigga that can catch Osama
Spray lambas and get good head and fuck fly bitches with no covenant
Only the kitchen oven and rules to the government
Ask the republicans how crack cocaine get smuggled in?
Watch them throw they hands up and say it wasn?t them
As for rap, this is my lyrical asthma attack
It?s all I know, the guns, the cash, the dro
Fidel Castro on my own right, capone like
My fioso been franky on the low pro.
Drop top Bentley, chromed out semi
Two ran on popular demand like the first penny
My order more PK, wrist saying kinda deep
Throw DJ quake, tell em other niggas to taste this
Who the buck 50 what?s coming out the speakers
Got every video bitch scared the fuck of me
[Chorus]
Having hard times
There?s no love to be found
Having hard times
There no love to be found
[Lil Wayne]
Shit gangster to the core
Ain?t no rap flame paint your kitchen floor
What you, you can?t ignore
Things you endure went up against the board
All I hard was easy don?t feel me no more
I hear your bullshit I play mad at door
I?m outta category I ain?t there with you
I got a positive vibe I ain?t scared of yours
Hit the kid nigga they?ve never did it wrong
I got a girl so fine her name Perrignon
She know how to get them thangs and carry on
I blow outta town when gas is outta town
Uptown in the building how that sounds
Cause killas don?t get dirty about
They get whispered about and get murdered about boi
[Chorus]
Having hard times
There?s no love to be found
Having hard times
There no love to be found
[Lil Wayne]
You got it on your mind look daddy say something
All I played buttoned get your face buttoned up
And now when you smirk you look like Jay Z?s shirt
Sippin on turf
[The Game]
Give them hard taking tampons
Shot of patron and don
The ones trained get ran on my crew hard
Louis V sweaters on the boulevard
Poor niggas cars throw up signs and bang on
[Lil Wayne]
They call me J.R. I tell em come holla
I tell my poppa put away your dollars your son got choppers
And if you get enemy?s your son got enemies that uptown energy
[The Game]
Niggas never gon be on my level
Get a shovel dig a hole
Bitch impala with he devil you an acquired hustler
I?m a 80?s baby for real born in 79 and ready to kill
[Chorus]
Havin hard times
There's no love to be found
Havin hard times
There no love to be found
Yeah, let's take 'em back
Uh huh
Comin' up I was confused, my mama kissin' a girl
Confusin' occurs, comin' up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committin' felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing ch-check out my melody
I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope
Four-four fingering, one of them gold ropes
Nanna told me if I pass I'll get a sheep skin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'll be dope
Tossed and turn in my sleep that night
Woke up the next mornin' niggas done stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothin' good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could
Hate it or love, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me
Hate it or love, the underdog's ontop
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me
I told Dre from the gate, I carry the heat fo' ya
First mixtape song, I inherited beef fo' ya
Gritted my teeth fo' ya, G-G-G'd fo ya (G-Unit)
Put Compton on my back when you was in need of soldiers
At my last show, I threw away my NWA gold
And had the whole crowd yellin' free Yayo
So niggas better get up outta mine
Before I creep and turn ya projects into Columbine
And I'm rap's MVP
Don't make me remind y'all what happened in D.C.
This nigga ain't Gotti, he pretend
Mad at us, cause Ashanti's got a new boyfriend
And it seems your little rat turned out to be a mouse
This beef shit is for the birds and the birds fly south
Even Young Buck can vouch, when the doubts was out
Who gave the West Coast mouth to mouth
Hate it or love, the underdog's ontop
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me
Hate it or love, the underdog's ontop
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me
From the beginnin' to the end
Losers lose, winners win
This is real, we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in
Is full of pressure and pain
I thought it would change
Its stayin' the same
How many hidden bowls is with'cha ya
When you had that little TV you had to hit on to get a picture
I'm walkin' with the snub, cause niggaz do a lotta slick talkin' in the club
Till they coughin' on the rug, ain't never had much but a walkman and a bud
My role model is gone, snortin' up his drug, bad enough they want me to choke
My boy just got poked in the throat, now its a R.I.P. shirt in my coat
Now I'm speedin' reminiscin', holdin' my weed hit never listen
If I see him then I'ma lift'em and maybe that'll even the score
And if not, then it'll be me on the floor
Hate it or love, the underdog's ontop
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me
Hate it or love, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me
I started out at fifteen, scared as hell
I took thirty off a pack and I made them sell
As a youth, man I used to hustle for loot
With that little deuce deuce and my triple fat goose
Sippin' easy Jesus rockin' the leases
My mama whipped me when she found my pieces
I look back on life and think God I bless
We the best on the planet so forget the rest
You know I'm still nice with my cook game
Look man, its a hood thing that's why I'm loved in Brooklyn
I handle mine just like a real nigga should
If I do some time, homie I'm still all good
Let me show what a thug bout born to die
I took the bullets outta 50, put 'em in my four five
And I ain't even got my feet wet yet
A seven figure nigga who ain't seen a royalty check
Hate it or love, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me
Hate it or love, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me

New york, New york, wake up LA
Wave hi to the Chi, let's get right today
I heard them lil' niggas takin' their life away
I heard a couple lil' niggas got life today
Is it farrakhan, buddha, or christ today?
She on her knees so she know what it's like to pray
She got religious so she doin' it twice a day
I strap up, no I ain't throwin' dice today
When you got money on yo head it's a price to pay
And it get cold in the hood, put your ice away
They locked rick ross up and they ain't give him no bail
But a cracker shoot a whole church up and it's "oh well"
Oh well, oh well
Hang him with a confederate flag in his cell
Let him sit there and rot 'til his body turns to bones
Just remember who casted the first stone
New york, New york, good mornin' LA
Say hi to the Chi, celebrate to the Bay
No hesitation like steph, shoot it right in your face
Cause I'm a golden state warrior strapped with a K
How's it land of the free, when we're trapped in a cage?
Some shit just never make sense like magic and aids
Some shit just never make sense like bashin' the gays
Obama must be in the city, it's traffic today
Niggas trappin' today just like back in the day
We like roc-a-fella records, we packagin' yay
And that dirty sprite 2 shit slappin' today
We got these niggas boxed in like cassius clay
And my feregammo belt where that ratchet stay
Cause the police killing too many blacks today
I wake up in the morning like who gon' pass away?
Who gon' blast today? who gon' have to pray?"
New york, New york
Good morning LA my nigga haze blew him and his wife away

Ha ha, Eastwood nigga check it out
Yo, I caught 'em at the corner liquor store, ran 'em for his jewels
Told 'em gimme everything you got, hat to the shoes
You done showed me what it is, now show me what it do
I done jacked a gang of bitch ass niggaz like you
My profile suspect, I'm wanted for murder
Investigated by the feds on no shit I ain't heard of
In '94 they say the wood was involved wit' a carjackin'
That's when my phone started trippin', I'm knowin' my shits out
Tryin' to tell me how I'm livin' like they B.E.T
Sometimes I feel like it's a camera in my T.V screen
I am the best ever since my moms left, I ain't holdin' my breath
I'm prosecuted to death, it's Eastwood, I'm as deadly as turpentine
Spittin' venomous rhymes with more heart then valentine when we ride
3 Killas on the rise

Life is what you make it
Sometimes I see blatant visions of Satan
I been smokin' hella the marijuana vapors
Wit' dreams of gettin' paper on felonious capers
Rent a car from Avis bangin' the best of Anita Baker
Now is that sacred when niggaz spend money on Jacobs
And it's that same shit that get blood spilled on the pavement
I'm patiently waitin' for God to open heaven gates
And I'll take a knife in my heart before I'll murder my neighbor
And for that I'm hated 'cause most of they rhymin' is basic
Drop 1 album and left the whole world stuck in amazement
Started wit' Rakim found him in my moms basement
One demo tape and I'm on Em & Dr. Dre shit
3 Killas on the rise
Come through scremin' homicide
When we ride

Come through screamin' homicide

The hood got me feelin' like my back against the wall
But I been here befo', let me fly or give me death
I'm in here for dough, my pops used to hustle the corner
In lotto kicks attempted to try 'em on, didn't like that fit
Went after a record deal, shit I got that super size
Niggaz ain't fly then Tec at this shit, I'm a natural nigga
So it's only right we boss up after these figgaz
So classical nigga
I'll document the avenue, study the set back to the O.G's
Create a new avenue niggaz, so we can ride
Rims spinnin' off the chrome, check the rear view wave
Spinnin' off the dome, honey the west coast is home

AY YO!

Now watch his face blow, YAYO!
Heard you hidin' in the big apple
Better keep hidin' 'for them Puerto Ricans kidnap you
9-3 gangsta ties
hatians down in Miami (zoe gang!)
yeah, them hatians down in Miami
Fat Joe don't fuck with you, Nas don't like you
So who they gonna blame when they long nose snipe you
Potato on the mussel, black tape on the grip
We in the A-Team van with black tape on your bitch
She gonna tell us where you at
We gonna twist that dro'
and just wait 'til that rat come out the that hole
No, the streets ain't safe
When we see him we gonna eat that face
No body we gonna beat that case
Yeah, it's on again, two shots of patron I'm in
Drive slow and let the motherfuckin' chrome extend
[Chorus:(The Game)]
Out in the streets they call it murder (whispering: murder, murder, murderer kill, kill, kill...)
(You can't fuck with the real!)
Out in the streets they call it murder (murder, murder, murderer kill, kill, kill...)
(Nigga, don't cross the real!)
They call it murder They call it murder They call it murder
(murder, murder, murderer kill, kill, kill...)
They call it murder
(You can't fuck with the real!)
They call it murder They call it murder They call it murder They call it murder
(Nigga, don't cross the real!)
[Verse 2]
What type of bitch niggaz put his hands on kids (HOMO!)
Pull up that black van on his (Nope)
We don't do the kid slap,nah we do the kid snatchin'
Eyewitness news, there's been a kidnappin'
Feed 'em real good, takin' home to play with Harlem
Sit by the phone, just wait it's your daddy callin'
Nah, we don't get down like that
but 50's momma we'll put you in the ground like that
Cuuuurtisss
Tryin' to make peace with Dipset
but you ain't even address the beef with Jin yet
It's on now, better call dr. Ben and Russell
Set up a peace treaty or go get some muscle
Call the lighty brothers, call all your lil' flunkies
Call the snitch hotline and get the G-Unit monkeys
Call the cops, I'm still 100 miles an runnin'
Then call the God and tell him that your ass is comin'
[Chorus:(The Game)]
Out in the streets they call it murder (murder, murder, murderer kill, kill, kill...)
(You can't fuck with the real!)
Out in the streets they call it murder (murder, murder, murderer kill, kill, kill...)
(Never cross the real!)
They call it murder They call it murder They call it murder
(murder, murder, murderer kill, kill, kill...)
They call it murder
(You can't fuck with the real!)
They call it murder They call it murder They call it murder They call it murder
(Never cross the real!)
[Verse 3]
This ain't "Ether", nah, this ain't "Hit 'em up"
This is a lot of dead bodies, who gonna pick them up
We just shot the coroner
Who gonna drive the truck
Fuck the whole G-Unit, who lied to Buck
Fuck Spider too, now that's for Big Face
I know where you countin' your sheeps
I'll have some Crips waitin'
youtube banger, tell me how that clip taste
You kiss Akisha in that mouth, tell me how my dick taste(uhh)
I got the crown nigga, it's going down nigga
and Los Angelesss - it's my town nigga!
I got a place where bodies don't get found nigga
Where the dead sleep and ghost don't make a sound nigga
The real 50 Cent, he knew Jimmy Henchmen, the real Jimmy Henchmen
Look at them niggaz flinchin'
We ain't gonna do shit
I'll have your crew sit
So play like them is toy guns and this is just music
[Chorus: (The Game)]
Out in the streets they call it murder (murder, murder, murderer kill, kill, kill...)
(You can't fuck with the real!)
Out in the streets they call it murder (murder, murder, murderer kill, kill, kill...)
(Don't ever cross the real!)
They call it murder They call it murder They call it murder
(murder, murder, murder kill, kill, kill...)
They call it murder
(Niggaz can't fuck with the real!)
They call it murd... They call it murder They call it murder They call it murd...
(Don't fuck with the real!)

You can catch five, or catch me in the CL-5
Whatever way dog, the Game get live
Keepin it gangsta in a P.D. city velour
Late night I'm in Dublin's and I got myself a four
The hood love me, hoodrats gotta hug me
Pop ex, spark the buba, the shit get ugly
Rock the mic anywhere, and I ain't talkin 'bout a concert dog
Talkin 'bout ten niggaz in Converse dog
Get it crackin like we out in the yard, and the warden's watchin
Only difference is the whores is watchin
Still love to see a nigga, roll up on 20's
Hop in that six-four, roll up on Bentley's like
I'm a gangsta bay-bee, from the C-P-T
Run with the (Pound) like I'm from DPG
If it's beef, you C-Murder like it ain't No Limit
And I represent the P like Russell Simmons
[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I'm a neighborhood superstar, get it, right
Got it? Good, okay
It's the Black Sox and Get Low we get dough
In the Yay they pimp hoes, in Compton we six-fo'
[JT the Bigga Figga]
I know ya, love to watch me, 'specially when I'm lookin rocky
The trey with the broccoli with my handles on the Kawasaki
Handle my jewels with the cuff in my shoes
AD jacket on my elbow, 50 coast the jewels
In my neighborhood I'm Young Bill Gates, never shuffle the cake
So cover my face, and run up in the place
I'm a superstar, dick and my chain, glass bezel and bang
80 karats on my pinky and rang
Crews buzz when you speakin my name, cause I'm deep in the game
With top cool thangs and million dollar planes
I'm a maniac, young boy gone, like a young Roy Jones
You ought of my zone and ain't nobody home
In my neighborhood, produce stars, stakes is high
Now we soarin through the spacious skies
Drop yo' body with them cakes and ride, the handle is up
Switchin gears with the pedal and ride
[Chorus]
[The Game]
I'm a shining star
And I gotta hit the boulevard in that new Jaguar
Why he move through traffic like that, purple haze
Ralways, the Ojays, the gangsta lean so
Please believe that I keep two G's in my jeans
Two gats in my sleeve, two rats in my Beam'
X-5, mami let's ride
Weave in and out of traffic from Compton to Bed-Stuy
It's the kid from the far West I, oh, shit
He know how to do more than flip pies
Get money like them stick up guys
Them "Ocean 11" licks got the young kid rich for life
And I talkin 'bout a movie or George Clooney
I'm talkin 'bout, runnin in your spots with uzis tucked in the Coogi
Dude me? Naw truly, might lose your lives
They say I've, got 2K2 covered like A.I.
[Chorus]
[JT]
Yeah mayne, I told y'all mayne
Fillmoe California nigga where we launch the best nigga

Nigga i lock the whole block up
See the block what
You can't stop us or drop us
Long nose, sluggin the drop what
We real niggas
Compton blood runnaz and gunnaz
The red raiders been on hiatus
Made it back for the summer
Fuck rap, it aint about that
Hip hop is dead
You whack rappers broke one in the head
NaS said it he aint regret it
I talk to him
Any nigga disagree
Run up on the passenger side
And put a spark to him
Phony ass rap niggas
Swear they gon clap some
Talkin out the side of they mouth
With no dare frontin
Long as i'm alive, this shit don't stop
We know who killed BIG and Pac
He gon' drop
[Talking]
You niggas think you scare me?
Nigga you don't scare me B
I'm from Compton mothafucka
Real life, real gangs, real shootouts mothafucka I took them shots
I see you standin there
So what bitch? Move!
[Verse 2]
I'm the west Don
The next one to kick his fuckin feet up
Puffin on chiefa
Niggas give me the chills
I pick the heat up
Im scared of who, you? Fuck no
I let the shit blow
Circle the block, before I duck off
I stay blunted, stay around pussy
Stay liquored up wit the finest bitches
You niggas trickin
I'm wit the barks like Milwaukee
I shoot em dead
Left hand like Michael Red
Recycle the flow, come back
I'm dead prez
Too political
Guerilla on mass beats
Leave your careerer in critical condition
Destroy niggas, my mission is to disposition
All you faggots
I ain't beefin with one nigga
Theres room for all you niggas in this casket
Get in
[Talking]
All homo ass niggas, B
Niggas straight fuckin homos nigga
When you see me in the streets nigga
You dont say shit
Niggas dont be doin shit
Whole bunch of niggas man
Loud noise makers, fuck yall

The moral is you die wit me
[Talking]

Fourth of all you ain't got enough OG mothafuckin homies backin you nigga
Fifth of all, fuck you
Intro (From Anchorman)
------
Now before we do this, let's go over the ground rules.
But not yet! Now Let's do this.
Verse 1 (The Game)
------
Public Enemy number 2, the flow is illegal,
and these ain't diesel, all fucking Evisu,
These is Levi's, equipped with the desert eagle,
run, tell your people, that nigga get evil,
throw em off the bridge like Knievel,
you niggas see-through,
like lingerie pussies I get funky like D.O.C. do,
one classic, now homie, OG too,
I toast a chronic blunt everytime I see Snoop,
Aston Martin Driver, gave away the B(entley) Coupe,
cried for three days, after that I had to re-group,
bullet-proof suburban, nigga fuck with that,
shoot the tires out, drive 60 miles on a flat,
flip the motherfucker over watch it slide on its back,
let the windows up as bullets fly out the Mac,
no gunpowder on me, I'm as fly as the Mac,
lyrical homicide, watch them die on the track. (nigga)
Chorus
------
Lyrical homicide,
kill them and watch them die, yeah,
(The Game)
Because you ain't never seen a motherfucker,
kill a motherfucker,
like a motherfucker nigga named Game, motherfucker,
Lyrical homicide,
kill them and watch them die, yeah,
(The Game)
Because you ain't never seen a motherfucker,
kill a motherfucker,
like a motherfucker nigga named Game, motherfucker,
Verse 2 (Lil' Wayne)
------
Yeah, I'ma murder this shit,
tell Dr. Dre to give me surgery quick,
Weezy from the dirty south, yeah, the dirtiest bitch,
but I'm clean like a virgin and detergent and shit, (ha)
I walked into the record store drooling,
because it's like a supermarket to me,
yeah, and as my appetite gets bigger,
I see you new rappers and you look like dinner,
lyrical killer,
I kill at will,
and my flow keeps going when the beat stand still,
how real is that? Nigga that's for real,
fuck with me and you're pushing up daffodils,
so don't you get this rap twisted,
fuck around and get your cap twisted,
stop it right there, rewind it back and listen,
and you have just become another victim.
Chorus
------
Lyrical homicide,
kill them and watch them die, yeah,
(The Game)
Because you ain't never seen a motherfucker,
kill a motherfucker,
like a motherfucker nigga named game, motherfucker,
Lyrical homicide,
kill them and watch them die, yeah,
(The Game)
Because you ain't never seen a motherfucker,
kill a motherfucker,
like a motherfucker nigga named game, motherfucker,
This is my home, feel me

And all my killa cali niggaz stay given it up uh
Yeah, if I left you out man holla at me
My bad it's all love
[Verse 1]
Yeah though I walk through the valley of death
Vest on, Teflon NOW IM approached in my Hurricane sweats
Black chrome my shoulder, big wheel 'till it's over
He never got to see me put black chrome on the Rova
Reading your obituary wishing we never met
So I wouldn't have to shed tears or wake up in cold sweats
Lookin' at this bottle of Hennessy wishing you never left
Wishing I chased your Monte Carlo down and gave you my vest
Or better yet I wish they never let you out
And I never got that phone call tellin' me that you out
Wish you never signed the release form
I wouldn't have had to clear this sample
Or use this track to say rest in peace for him
You wanted to know if Dre and Em felt you?
They did, before I could tell you somebody killed you
I feel pain for everybody that ever knew the real you
Call Nas tell him that I got an Ill Will too
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
Niggas politickin' wanna know why I'm rhymin' different
My best friend got murdered, nigga my mind is different
If you ain't never spent no time in prison
You can't understand these bars or the lines I'm spittin'
Niggas rilin' me up let's go find a victim
I can't do it homie that's the reason Shyne in prison
And through divine intervention ten plus years doing crime in the trenches
Multiply by the time we spent in the kitchen
It's a life worth of hard livin', Cuban cigar tippin'
Twelve grade ditchin', purple serve by the jar sippin'
If you lost a homie you know friendship is God given
I've done seen the church so much you'd think I was born Christian
I've done seen more dead bodies than a mortician
Seen niggas in and out of county blues like they was born crippin'
So I'ma keep on livin' cause when I'm gone niggas ain't gonna do shit
But fuck my bitch and poor liquor
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
What if you was me
And you had to sit through an entire funeral
While the Pastor readin' your homeboy's eulogy
I'm already dead
What the fuck you gonna do to me?
Keep talking shit I'll empty my clip in that G-Unit tee
Gimme a minute to say my grace with God
I'll see your face in the mirror I came a long way to talk
And tell you your Moms is missing you
Your Pops is missing you
Just saw your baby pictures in your Grandmother's living room
Face is missing you homie
Wink is missing you
Thank God you left us memories and songs to listen to
VALE is missing you
The hood is missing you
Let my son graduate high school
And I'm gonna come visit you
The world is missing you
Eminem was feeling you
Dre said he felt your vibe the little time we spent with you
Pour the Henny out 'cause he ain't here in the physical
They say real men don't cry but nigga I'm missing you
[Chorus]
A lot of people are advocated
That the rich gets richer and the poor gets poorer.
That's only because you don't understand
Whats going to happen to you,
You see its all just a game ladies and gentlemen,
And the quality of your living depends entirely
Upon your ability to play the game,
And I play the game
Hey, Skee, tell 'em I'm goin' away for a while
(A Million) Motherfukka's wanna see me dead
(A Million) Motherfukka's wanna see me in the fed's
(A Million) Bitches wanna give me head
(A Million) Dollars in my bank account
(A Million) Soundscan the first week out
(A Million) Motherfukka's on my dick
(A Million) Motherfukka's talking shyt
Hit a break down...
I'm the king, and you better respect it
All I need is Beyonce, and a Roc-a-fella necklace
Nigga you can "check up on it", I'm a Slim Thug
Cincinnati fitted, wit the red and black brim blood
Gave nigga's 300 bars, two mixtapes, and a DVD
I did it for the C.P.T.
Did it for New York, did it for Chi-town
Ran through hip-hop, and made these nigga's lie down
I'm going away for awhile, call it a California vacation
I call it a Bentley with a smile
GOD bless the child, wit incredible style
Nigga sicker than West Nile, who king of the West now
I'm putting my vest down, nigga's ain't going to kill shit
Shut the fuck up, nigga you ain't going to kill shit
Rappers don't kill rappers, guns kill rappers
And I be wit real crips, real bloods, real clappers
Fuck rappin, these nigga's will push ya grill backwards
Faster than Iraqis when Bush attacking
My flow semi-automatic, blhow
Touching pussies is my job, you a bitch, this is sexual harrassment
Nigga get a lawyer, when 'The Game' coming for ya
My jab, like Zab on the chin of De La Hoya
I'm the golden boy, and I'm making Hova noise
Got the whole world clapping, just like the Nolia Boys
Since a juvenile, I had to prove my style
Went from Kayslay to DJ Clue, and blhow
20 Magazine covers, nigga look at me now
You need a hot 16?.. I need 100 thou
Cause half of these rap nigga's just be running they mouth
The other half, in the ATL runnin' the south
10 Mill in the bank, 7 bedroom house
I'm rich, so on my 30th birthday I'm out
Nigga, I'm so ahead of time, and I spit better lines
Better rhymes everytime, nigga's hate on me so much, I feel like I'm Kevin Federline
Fuck it im rich, for nothing, tell the media to get off of my dick
You wit me, my next album going to sell like Britney
I beat on these rap nigga's like Bobby do Whitney
No more drama, no more beef wit 50
And if you just tuning in, welcome to the 360 (welcome to the 360, welcome to the 360)
Right back where I started, in Compton, taking out the garbage
Where Crips and Bloods shoot it out like Pearl Harbor
That was '95, when Cube was in his prime
You brought yo Lethal Injection, and I brought mine
Rewind to '89, got my first mixtape
My brother brought it for me, they use to call him Big Face
But now, we ain't brothers, nigga we ain't shit
And you living in my shadow like Marcus Vick
And I heard about yo little rappers talking shit
Stay out my family bidness, or you get a coffin quick
I ain't change, same nigga that got off them bricks
Got signed to Dr.Dre cause his bars is sick
Getting head on the road, cause his cars is sick
And he whop so good, I had to pause this shit
I told 'em bomp, slow down baby
Got to get this shit firm like Foxy, NaS and AZ
She said 'fuck you,pay me
So I left her in AZ
That's what I get for letting her listen to my Jay-Z
Fuck a bitch, give me a 40, I'll take that
Dress up for the grammy's, but I still don't drive maybach's
Nigga I'm gangster, and homey don't play dat
Stand way back, or get ya ass clapped ASAP
Nigga this the payback, you want beef.. say that
I'll have a hundred hurricane hoodies where you lay at
Get yo whole clique wet, making up crip sets
Nigga got ran outta New York by Dipset
Then he got ran out of Compton by my set
Banned from Watts, can't even walk through his projects
Nigga so lame, talking he gangbang
Won't bust a shot, and the nigga know where I hang
I'm Big Daddy Kane, and the platinum chain
The fact remains, the game don't rap for fame
Game rap for fun, Game blast his gun
the game gotta rap in tongue, so that bastards done
Be easy, I might give you a pass this once
I'm ready to die, but I don't want a bastard son
Nigga, I rap too good, and I'm back in the hood
On the same couch, I put my demo in a package for Sug
After one meeting, I was right back in the hood
Red bandana hanging, selling crack in the hood
Now it's, Aftermath for good...
Any nigga mention Dre, get a Desert Eagle shoved in his fucking face
How that taste?
Blow yo shit out fa'real,
Call Nelly or Paul Wall, tell 'em make you a grill
I cook beef, like a steak on a grill
Got the clipse on hold, but I ain't Pharrell
Nigga I'm fa'real.. my flow ill, like smoke in ya lungs
I Spit sharp like a razorblade under my tongue
Nigga, I'm number one, motherfukka bar none
Who else kick knowlegde outside of Hova and the God Son
We can go bar for bar, cocksucker drop some(tm)
Watch me Take Flight like Tom Cruise in Top Gun
You might win some, but you just lost one
I beat on these lil nigga's like Dr. Dre drums
Look at these motherfukka's trying to prove theyselves
Thinking beefing wit hurricane going to boost they sales
Never that, motherfukka, I'm a clever cat
Kanye West in slacks, nigga, I'm as fresh as that
Ask Dre, ask Snoop, I'm nice
I'm Cube, I'm Jacob, I put rappers on "Ice"
A skee , let me ask you a question
If you take the 120 bars, put it with the 240 bars
Then add the 360 bars, wit one Kevin Federline, what you get?
(A Million) Haha.. lets get the fuck outta here man..
Go find something to do
Yo Havoc, I'm too close to the edge on this one nigga
I ain't gon' jump though, I'mma keep it raw gutter
Yo Prodigy, you know I need you on this one nigga
I got shit on my chest, I must confess
Last night I was the nigga that shot up your projects
Now I'm back in the hood, with rocks in the Pyrex
Tan khakis and them Nike Airs with the dyed checks
I was forced to live this life, forced to bust my chrome
My pops left me in a foster home
I felt abandoned like Quik now that Mausberg gone
So I don't hop in the SS without the Mossberg homes
I've been rappin' for a year and a half, my life is real
Put the gun in his mouth, he gon' bite the steel
Come to Compton, I got stripes for real
Before Dre, before the ice, before the deal - I was almost killed
Like 'Pac before the Death Row deal
I got shot over two pounds of weed, still ain't found them niggas
But karma come quicker for a nigga on the other side of the gun
That's somethin I gotta teach my son
I don't need your love, no no no no
I don't need your love
Need it, I don't want it, I don't need it
I don't need your love, no I don't need your love
I don't need your love
Cause, the, game, don't, change
I heard they got Bloods in New York now
Red rags in Uptown Harlem now, I need that love
Front court at the Knicks game, new chick, French name
New car, new house, and sometimes friends change
And you don't need that love, when you G's like us
And your Jesus piece is sim-u-lar to Biggie's
And your life story is sim-u-lar to 50's
First they hate you, then they love you, then they hate you again
What the fuck do it take for a gangsta to win?
No mics, no Unsigned Hype, nigga fuck The Source
Plus them awards I don't need
And them niggas breathing the same air as me, acting like they don't bleed
We don't drive the same speed, this a Continental T
That's a case of Armadale, this a continental suite
So I'mma drown in my own sorrows
Live life, fuck tomorrow, nigga cause reality is
I don't need your love, no no no no
I don't need your love
Need it, I don't want it, I don't need it
I don't need your love, no I don't need your love
I don't need your love
Cause, the, game, don't, change
I was gassed up, Murder Inc., Roc-A-Fella passed up
Sat in Daddy's House with Black Rob and Lou and asked Puff
Now The Game's set in stone, the Franck Muller's set in stones
Dre cut me a check, I'm gone
Tryin to be the king of the streets, niggas'll wet your throne
But I got nieces to feed, two coasts to please
So I roam through the city like the ghost of E
Gotta put Compton back where it's 'sposed to be
Nothing between all my niggas that's close to me
In the streets with two fellas packing toast for me
I'm 'posed to be, got all the critics watching my pivot
On my block in the Coupe reading kites from prison
I got niggas doing life in prison
All my fallen soldiers is one of the reasons we pour out liquor
So this song is for Ms. Wallace, Afeni Shakur
And all the mothers of dead sons that went out in the war
I don't need your love, no no no no
I don't need your love
Need it, I don't want it, I don't need it
I don't need your love, no I don't need your love
I don't need your love
Cause, the, game, don't, change
I don't need your love, no no no no
I don't need your love
Need it, I don't want it, I don't need it
I don't need your love, no I don't need your love
I don't need your love
Cause, the, game, don't, change
[Hook]
I just got home and I feel like a brand new day/
So I'm gon' roll 'till my wheels fall off/
I'ma take it one day at a time, snooze, I say
That's why I roll 'till my wheels fall off/
I got called once and I bet it gon' happen again if I/
Keep rollin' 'till my wheels fall off/
You only live once that's why I suggest to my friends that they/
Roll 'till your wheels fall off/
[Verse 1]
Glass house, candy painting, low ridin' twenty-two's/
Run up on my old schools, see what the semi do/
A hop out, corner store grab me a O.E./
White-tee dicky sagging G-Unit sneak's/
Twelve-inch cross-fires, you can still hear my speakers/
Dre started gangsta rappin' niggas still sleepin'/
Cashville Ten-e-key, Compton still got 'em cheaper/
Feds on next tails we still carry beepers/
Stash hold everything fire arms, cocain,
Drive-bys leave ya brains hangin' like my gold chain/
Ten G's on you fitted, fucking with my dope game/
Ski mask, climbing through your window like Bro, man/
In the hood fiends snitchin' on niggas for quarter rock/
Everybody on the floor, face down, gun shot/
All black bandana, infared, pass the glock/
Phantom in the drive way let the motha'fuckin' neighbourhood watch/
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Homie let the D R A M A pop/
'Fore a nigga clap back somebody gotta take shots/
Eighty-four magazine for that Benzino shit/
Don't believe the hype, Dre the Chuck D. in it/
Aftermath, G-Unit, Shady rap politics/
Eat this beef shit, load up hollow-tips/
Boys, I cock back forty-five, swallow shit/
Lift niggas souls up like a hydrolics switch/
All I know is gangbangin', bandana's, poppin' clips/
Ass out, three-wheelin', bangin' two 'pacalypse/
Hood rat, model chick, six-four impalla shit/
G's up, hoes down, make bitches swallow dick/
Suck me, Eminem, 50 Cent, Dr. Dre/
Young Buck, Lloyd Banks, D Mack, Big Fate/
Free Tony Yayo, suck him out of G-Unit/
Tell evil-kenevil nobody stuntin' like he do it/
But nah/
The Game ft. Cyssero AKA RockStar
Help 'Em Out
[Chorus]
(The Game)
Kanyeezy help em out please
Just bleezy help em out please
M-Eazy help em out please
Somebody go tell Free to help em out
yeah, young neefy help em out
dress up like RunDMC to help em out
yo peedi, go see beans and break him out
before i show these young dummies what beefing all about
(Cyssero)
Fresh off the tour bus, homie i'm back
I was stompin' in Compton, loading my strap
And niggas seem a little pissed
Cause now i'm in the city with huge canary yellow diamonds on my little wrist
All it took was one verse, and game was convinced
I got the straight jacket flow, i'm insane when i spit
How y'all talkin that Young Gun shit?
Y'all young but y'all ain't guns y'all ain't dumped one clip
I'm the Game's Young Gun and i'm one young pit
And i'll bite both of y'all fuck that Young Gun shit
Cause Chris is a snitch, even they know that
On the stand pointin now look where Spado at
Stuck behind prison bars, dealing with those prison guards
Only get to see outside when he in the prison yard
And this some real nigga shit real niggas rather give you a shell
Than send you to jail
[chorus]
(Cyssero)
A real nigga ain't Chris, a real nigga ain't Neef
A real nigga that's Cyss, so how you feelin hard?
I went from runnin' the underground
To the Black Wall, so i'm still in charge
You wanna holla at Game? now Cyss involved
Y'all ain't sick at all, plus y'all niggas been slippin off
Chris stole Jay hov's style, get off his dick and balls
Y'all rappers can't rap, that's why Mac ain't stick with y'all
I got little Neef complaining to Chris
Like "what we gonna do, he's with the Game and he's sick"
Yeah, i keep the thang on my hip
And i aim to draw blood like a blood when he bangin a crip
You should never bite the hand that feed you
Sucking so much Hova dick, you done turned your back on Sigel
And none of y'all clapped that chrome
So i wouldn't be suprised you get smacked up when Mac come home
And this cat not shook,
That's why i'm the most talked about Philly since Mac got booked
[chorus]
(The Game)
Let me tell you 'bout the boys and where they come from
Grew up in nice town, how they call themselves the Young Gunz
Dame Dash left, now Beans don't fuck with em
Free signed to Jay, and R O C got stuck with them
Now Def Jam can't even make a buck with em
Cause they ain't got them teairra marie cuts in em
When i blaze, it'll feel like a truck hit em
Leave 'em like a swisha in philly with no guts in them
A hundred pound slug slice right through them
Hit the corner, bullets curve like the logo on the Pumas
hollows in one ear and out the other like a rumor
He got shot before he got a chance to grow a sooner
Then i'ma drive by lootin and choose
Put the Hemi in Neef mouth while he chewin his food
Everybody in Philadelphia know that you'se the fool
You gonna make me, make Jay lose his cool
[chorus]
(The Game)
First buddens, the bleek, then the whole g-unit
that's a staff, record label and a motherfuckin group
now you little faggots
i sold more records for y'all than y'all did your motherfuckin self
The new Prince of Philly...RockStar
[The Game]
Death before dishonor
Ride with weap' up, cause niggaz tryin to dent my armor
Cold streets, Telly Mac keep the guns on 'em
They wanna know how that nigga from California
could run up on ya on any corner
Put somethin on ya
How I stuff bricks in the 6, with no crack aroma
Dawg, I'm just livin for the moment
I'm from Compton homey, but I'm like a center for Milwaukee
Cause I play for the Bucks, and I keep the 40 on me
Gotta keep the chrome-y, gotta keep my back to the wall
Wait for Q to rock me up, like cavi dawg
Speakin of lle', I put 8 in, 10 jump back hard
And watch my money come back, like Jordan in charge
I'm like the black Yankees, they don't want me around no more
Cause I hold the record for the most fiends roamin the boulevard
And when I'm on the boulevard, catch me behind the wheel
of that new Escalade with the Foreman grill
[Chorus - repeat 2X]
Steppin out of Chevies with heat that's heavy - that's president
Bullets flyin for them dead guys - that's president
Led meltin inside your wig - that's president
20's 50's and 100's burnin - it's all president
[Telly Mac]
Aiyyo I do this shit from Compton to the Mac block
High-tech collaborations with the Gamblaz and Blacksox
Drillin 'em killin 'em if we ain't feelin 'em nigga
If Sticky Fingaz need some music straight stealin it nigga
Shinin, in big trucks, big will in it nigga we climbin
To the top and we sealin it nigga
So back the fuck up, my niggaz act the fuck up
So keep yourself in line or you could get smacked the fuck up
Jacked the fuck up, beat up bad and clapped the fuck up
Wrapped up in white sheets and threw in a white truck
Over presidents, now you willin to give your life up?
Put your kids on the line, and give your wife up?
Over presidents, they got you soulless
So take this bomb and hold this, while we control this
For the streets, we comin with heat that's stolen
And we hustle universal, for that paper that we foldin
Roll in 600's, Beemers and 'llacs
We a team of cats, with the pens and gats
That fiend for jacks, but only when the green's attached
We fiend for jacks, but only when the green's attached
[Chorus]
[The Game]
It's Telly and young Game the hustler, ho juggler, coke smuggler
No matter what the hustle, dough doublin
Lle or the rock, give me a day and a spot
And I bet I'll come back with 10K in the drop
[Telly Mac]
I'll stay in the spot, wearin a crop and coppin ounces
Telly Mac and Game the hustler, we rock the house
And plus we the reason that the blocks is out
So my words to the wise is just watch your mouth
[The Game]
And you don't want it when the stainless out, what the game about
The bullets is in, your brains is out
All over Frisco and Compton dawg, we ruthless
And the truth is y'all niggaz can't stop us dawg
[Telly Mac]
So why the fuck you wanna knock us off
Like we some high-powered cowards and y'all really the niggaz that's soft
Still across the train tracks, we turn 'caine crack
It's Telly Mac and Game the hustler, you can't change that
[Chorus] - to fade w/ Digital Underground
You can me catch rolling down Crenshaw (Crenshaw)
Is that a motherfucking Impala? (Bitch Yeah)
Magazine on my lap, I'm rolling indo
Gang signs, watch us throw them out the window
Gang signs
Parked at the light, give a fuck about a bitch nigga
Only nigga worth six figures that still click triggers
On my way to LAX, fuck the freeway
Riding through South Central in the 'Wood like I should
But I'm a Compton nigga, west side monster nigga
You should know by now, I fuck with all kinds of niggas
Call Big U and we going to see about that vagina in you
You don't bang huh? That's that out of town in you
My niggas eat late night, Mel's Diner menu
You a shooter? Better have that North Carolina in you
I had wolves at all kinds of venues
Dub's show I let the snub show
Shall I continue?
Fucking niggas up like it was '05
Like Dre just listened to my whole demo and cosigned
Talking out your neck, get you buried in no time
I heard you niggas looking for me, Blood
You can me catch rolling down Crenshaw (Crenshaw)
Is that a motherfucking Impala? (Bitch Yeah)
Magazine on my lap, I'm rolling indo
Gang signs, watch us throw them out the window
Gang signs
Nip be where the Crips be
Skeme be where the Bloods be
Nigga, I'm with the shit, give a fuck if niggas Cuz me
Say the wrong things wrong time, get a blood beef
Same color rag, still laying where the subs be
Naw fuck that nigga
I'll have a prostitute to open the trunk and cut that nigga
I'll have a couple crooked cops come and touch that nigga
Then get a bully in the pen to come and fuck that nigga
Life is crazy, yeah my life is crazy
Don't let Calabasas fool you, I'll kill you baby
Bury you in my backyard, shit I'm sittin on five acres
You wanna go to war? I got the paper
Nigga wanna fade? I got the taper
Nigga want to shoot? I got the laser
Any bitch that want to fuck, I got a take it
And I don't put no tints on my whip
One strap, full clip nigga!
You can me catch rolling down Crenshaw (Crenshaw)
Is that a motherfucking Impala? (Bitch Yeah)
Magazine on my lap, I'm rolling indo
Gang signs, watch us throw them out the window
Gang signs
Bullets coming through the windows and the walls
That's on the set, all my niggas on call
Don't pray for me, pray for them niggas
Menace to society, I'm like Lorenz nigga
I want the rims nigga, and your gold chain
Don't blame me, blame 80s and cocaine
I want the rims nigga, and your gold chain
Don't blame me, blame 80s and cocaine
Ay yo I wake up, put on chronic like bitches makeup
Kush like Nicki and Meek, it's hard to breakup
38 tucked, take a piss and eat my breakfast
Six bitches at my kitchen table ass naked
I got more bitches than Hugh Heff, niggaI 'm reckless
Iced out Playboy pendant hanging from my necklace
Used to take a brick chop that bitch up in sections
Pack it in the car like its Mexican no flexin'
It's that whip work, chop that, sell it out, we cop that
On Wimbleton and Brazil in my impala with the top back
Where my nigga Top at?
Remember them days before you and Rock brought Watts back?
We was in Stevenson Village in front your crib nigga
Leanin like a top hot, ordering Tommy burgers with everything
Cop back my Glock fat nina Ross Akon black
Bullets pop up out of nowhere like State Farm BLAT!
Yeah, let's take 'em back
Uh huh
Comin' up I was confused, my mama kissin' a girl
Confusin' occurs, comin' up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committin' felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing ch-check out my melody
I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope
Four-four fingering, one of them gold ropes
Nanna told me if I pass I'll get a sheep skin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'll be dope
Tossed and turn in my sleep that night
Woke up the next mornin' niggas done stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothin' good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could
Hate it or love, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me
Hate it or love, the underdog's ontop
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me
I told Dre from the gate, I carry the heat fo' ya
First mixtape song, I inherited beef fo' ya
Gritted my teeth fo' ya, G-G-G'd fo ya (G-Unit)
Put Compton on my back when you was in need of soldiers
At my last show, I threw away my NWA gold
And had the whole crowd yellin' free Yayo
So niggas better get up outta mine
Before I creep and turn ya projects into Columbine
And I'm rap's MVP
Don't make me remind y'all what happened in D.C.
This nigga ain't Gotti, he pretend
Mad at us, cause Ashanti's got a new boyfriend
And it seems your little rat turned out to be a mouse
This beef shit is for the birds and the birds fly south
Even Young Buck can vouch, when the doubts was out
Who gave the West Coast mouth to mouth
Hate it or love, the underdog's ontop
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me
Hate it or love, the underdog's ontop
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me
From the beginnin' to the end
Losers lose, winners win
This is real, we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in
Is full of pressure and pain
I thought it would change
Its stayin' the same
How many hidden bowls is with'cha ya
When you had that little TV you had to hit on to get a picture
I'm walkin' with the snub, cause niggaz do a lotta slick talkin' in the club
Till they coughin' on the rug, ain't never had much but a walkman and a bud
My role model is gone, snortin' up his drug, bad enough they want me to choke
My boy just got poked in the throat, now its a R.I.P. shirt in my coat
Now I'm speedin' reminiscin', holdin' my weed hit never listen
If I see him then I'ma lift'em and maybe that'll even the score
And if not, then it'll be me on the floor
Hate it or love, the underdog's ontop
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me
Hate it or love, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me
I started out at fifteen, scared as hell
I took thirty off a pack and I made them sell
As a youth, man I used to hustle for loot
With that little deuce deuce and my triple fat goose
Sippin' easy Jesus rockin' the leases
My mama whipped me when she found my pieces
I look back on life and think God I bless
We the best on the planet so forget the rest
You know I'm still nice with my cook game
Look man, its a hood thing that's why I'm loved in Brooklyn
I handle mine just like a real nigga should
If I do some time, homie I'm still all good
Let me show what a thug bout born to die
I took the bullets outta 50, put 'em in my four five
And I ain't even got my feet wet yet
A seven figure nigga who ain't seen a royalty check
Hate it or love, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me
Hate it or love, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me
[The Game]

Yeah if I left you out man holla at me, my bad it's all love
My love for you
is like a angel flyin' thru the sky
like a bird in the winter, and
your love for me
is so deep, and sorta like a black rose cracking the cement
My love for you
lives on like the memory of Aaliyah singin' a last song
and your love for me
will never die like a black child struggling the ghetto to survive
My heart goes out to the beautiful woman that raised me
20 years after the Watts Riot, early 80's
pops on drugs, moms couldn't take me in
had a daughter already, said she was to young to feed another baby
and shit got crazy, then 2 years came went
baby's just growing away, we can't even pay the rent
no hot water, i reminisce, tears runnin' down my face as i hold my daughter
you spent years by the fire place, i was in the garden every Sunday at the church
bible study at the carters, i was hard head
back then i was selling crack
when your hard earned money paid for basketball practice
always at the game on time, yelling at the coaches
wondering why your baby boy's sitting on the pine
even thou life gets hard sometimes, i keep my head up
and i can make the sun shine in just one rhyme
walk with me.
My love for you
is like a angel flyin' thru the sky
like a bird in the winter, and
your love for me
is so deep, and sorta like a black rose cracking the cement
My love for you
lives on like the memory of Aaliyah singin' a last song
and your love for me
will never die like a black child struggling the ghetto to survive
And now the lanes at the 57 Lincoln Continental, peddle to the floor
looking for the highway to heaven, remember when your baby boy was 7
we had good times like i was Jay Jay and you was Florida Evans
I should have listen to the reverend, now i drain my pain in this 40 ounce
and these born ass records, disrespecting your house
living reckless, look at me, inside your jewelry box
about to pawn your necklace, every night you were in the window, lookin'
but what you do when your grandson's crooked, and he to old for whoopin'
used to tell me i was smarter than that, took me down to the Compton, swap meet,
bought my first starter hat, pulled over raider jacket to match
a pair of Levis, a number 8 Jordan's with the all black straps
when you died my soul cracked, can i get a soul clap
I'm walking without a heart, can somebody hold that
My love for you
is like a angel flyin' thru the sky
like a bird in the winter, and
your love for me
is so deep, and sorta like a black rose cracking the cement
My love for you
lives on like the memory of Aaliyah singin' a last song
and your love for me
will never die like a black child struggling the ghetto to survive
I got a lot of things i wanna ask the Lord
like why i can't see my grandmother face no more
and why i can't seem to live without her
and if i pray could he send her back to me one day
cause heaven to crowded, every time i think about it
i'm missin' your smile, can barely cough
my angel is gone, i'm heartbroke, drowning in my own tears
somebody throw me a robe or spread my wings so i can fly
i'm ready to die
might cry but i'm still a man, might be a man but i still cry
big mama my angel in the sky
if you wanna feel my pain, then close your eyes, hold your breath
now that's to close to death, open your eyes
see the light now, and if you love your grandmother like i love mine
go tell her right now, i know how this might sound
but my plan is to show you that i understand, you are appreciated
My love for you
is like a angel flyin' thru the sky
like a bird in the winter, and
your love for me
is so deep, and sorta like a black rose cracking the cement
My love for you
lives on like the memory of Aaliyah singin' a last song
and your love for me
will never die like a black child struggling the ghetto to survive
Hey, Skee, tell 'em I'm goin' away for a while
mufucka's wanna see me dead
mufucka's wanna see me in tha feds
bitches wanna give me head
dollas in my bank account
Soundscan the first week out
mufucka's on my dick
mufucka's talkin' shit
hit a breakdown, I'm the king, and you better respect it
all i need is Beyonce,AND A Rockafella necklace
Nigga, you can check up on it I'm a slim thug Cincinatti fitted with the red and black rim, blood
gave niggas 300 bars, 2 mixtapes, and a DVD
I did it for the CPT
Did it for New York
Did it for Chi-town
ran through hip hop and made these nigga's lie down
I'm goin' away for a while, call it a California vacation
I call it a Bentley with a smile =)
God Bless the child with incredible style, nigga sicka than the West Nile
Who's king of the West now?
I'm puttin' my vest down, niggas ain't gonna kill shit
Shut the fuck up,nigga, you ain't gon' kill shit
Rappers don't kill rappers, guns kill rappers
And I be with real crips, real bloods, real clappers
fuck rappin', these niggas'll push ya grill backwards
fasta than Iraqi's when Bush attacked'em
My flow semi-automatic
Touch'n pussies is my job, you a bitch, this is sexual harrassment
nigga get a lawyer when The Game comin' for ya
My jab like zab on a chin of Da Lahoya
I'm tha golden boy, and I'm makin' Hova noise
got tha whole world clappin just like them Noya Boys
Since a juvenile, i had to prove my style
Went from Kay Slay to DJ Clue then blaw(
20 magizine covers,nigga look at me now
You need a hot 16? I need a hot hundred thou
'causez half of these rap niggas just be runnin' they mouth
The other half in the ATL runnin' the South
10 mil in the bank, 7 bedroom house, i'm rich, so on my 30th birthday, I'm out
Nigga, i'm so ahead'a time, and i spit betta lines, betta rhymes
Every time niggas hate on me so much, I feel like I'm Kevin Federline
"fuck it I'm rich, for nothin', tell the media, get off'a my dick
You with me? my next album gon' sell like Britney
I beat on these rap niggas like Bobby do Whitney
No more drama, no more beef wit 50
And if ya just tunin' in, welcome to the 360, welcome to the 360, welcome to the 360
Right back where I started, in Compton, takin' out the garbage
Where Crips and Bloods shoot it out like Pearl Harbor
That was '95, when Cube was in his prime
You bought ya Lethal Injection, and I bought mine
Rewind to '89, got my first mixtape
My brotha bought it for me, they used to call him Big Fa$e
But now, we ain't brothers, nigga, we ain't shit
And you livin' in my shadow like Marcus Vick
And I heard about ya little rappers talkin' shit
Stay out my family business or you get a coffin quick
I ain't changed, same Nigga that got off them bricks
Got signed to Dr. Dre because his bars are sick
Gettin' head on tha road 'cause his cars are sick
And he rymed so good I had to pause the shit
I tell her boomp, slow down baby, I gotta get this shit firm like Foxy, Nas, and AZ
She said fuck you pay me, so I left her in A.Z.
That's what i get for lettin' her listen to my Jay-Z
fuck a bitch, give me a 40, I'll take that
Dress up for the Grammys, but i still don't drive Maybachs
Nigga, I'm a gangsta, and homie don't play dat
Stand way back, and get your ass clapped ASAP
Nigga, this the payback
You want beef, say that
I'll have a hundred Hurricane hoodies where you lay at
Get ya whole click wet, makin' up Crip sets, nigga got ran outta New York by Dipset
Then he got ran outta Compton by my set
Banned from Watts, can't even walk through his projects
Nigga so lame, talkin' he gang bang
Won't bust a shot, and tha nigga know where i hang
I'm Big Daddy Kane in the platinum chain, the fact remains,The Game dont' rap for fame
Game rap for fun, Game blast his gun, 'n Game got a rappin' tongue, so that bastard's done
Be easy, I might give you a pass this once
I'm Ready To Die, but I don't wanna basterd son
Nigga, I rap too good, and I'm back in the hood
On the same couch I put my demo and the package for Suge
After one meeting I was right back in the hood
Red bandana hangin' sellin' crack in the hood
Now it's Aftermath for good
Any nigga mention Dre get a Desert Eagle shoved in his face
How that taste? Blow ya shit out fa real
Call Nelly or Paul Wall, tell 'em make you a grill
I cook beef like a steak on the grill
Got tha clips on hold, but I ain't pharrel
Nigga I'm for real , my flow ill like smoke in ya lungs
I spit sharp, like a razor blade under my tongue
Nigga, I'm number one, motha fucka
Bar none, who else kick knowledge outside'a Hoa''n the God Son
'N we can bar for bar, cocksucker, drop some
Watch me take flight like Tom Cruise in Top Gun
You might win some, but you just lost one
I beat on these lil' niggas like Doctor Dre's drums
Look at these mufucka's tryin'a prove theyselves
Thinkin' beefin' wit Hurricane gon' boost they sells
Never that, muthafucka, I'm a clever cat
Kanye West and slacks, nigga, I'm as fresh as that
Ask Dre, ask Snoop, I'm nice
I'm Cube, I'm Jacob, I put rapper's on ice
"Hey, Skee, let me ask you a question-If you take the 120 bars, put it with the 240 bars, then add a 360 bars, with one Kevin Federline, what do you get? (a million) "Let's get tha fuck outta here, man, let's go find somethin' to do.

Yo Dre, I thought I was dead
West coast
I'm the doctor's advocate
Nigga Dre shot ya
Brought me back from the dead
That's why they call him the doctor
The mavs gon' drop em
If 50 ain't rockin' wit him no more
It's ok, I get it poppin'
The whole club rockin' like da 6-4 Impala
Drink Cris throw it up call the shit hydraulics
Then piss in the cup call the shit Hipnotiq
I bleed Compton, spit crack, the shit chronic
And you new niggas ain't shit but new niggas
Baped n ape shoe niggas I'm talkin' to you nigga
Bounce in the 6-4 throwin' up west side man
Sell another five million albums, yes I am
Fresh like damn dis nigga did it again
A hundred thousand on his neck, LA above the brim
Inside the Lambo', shotgun wit Snoop
What would the muthafuckin' west coast be without
One crip and one blood?
One blood, one blood, one blood
Blood, blood, blood
One blood, one blood, one blood, one blood, one blood
I'm from the west side of the 6-4 Impala
When niggas say, Where you from?
We'll never say holla
Bandana on the right side, gun on the left side
Niggas in New York know how to throw up the west side
Word to Eazy, I'm so ill believe me
I made room for Jeezy
But the rest of you niggas better be glad you breathing
All I need is one reason
I'm the King and Dre said it the west coast need me
I don't know why you niggas keep tryin' me
Everybody know that I'm the heir to the Aftermath dynasty
And I ain't got to make shit for the club
What DJ gon' turn down the 38 snub?
You 38 and you still rappin'? Uhh
I'm 26 nigga, so is the dubs
On the 07 Hummer hop out
Nobody guards, when the chronic
Smoke clear, all you gon' see is one blood
One blood, one blood, one blood
Blood, blood, blood
One blood, one blood, one blood, one blood, one blood
I ain't got beef wit 50, no beef wit J
What's beef when you gettin' head in the 6 trey?
And the double game change, I keep em on display
Black t-shirt so all you see is the A
Turn on the TV and all you see is the A
You niggas better make up a dance and try to get radio play
Keep on snappin' your fingers, I ain't goin' away
I don't regret what I spit, cause I know what I say
And niggas talk about me, they don't know when to stop
I got the Louis Vuitton belt buckle holdin' the glock
No beam, no silencer, I know when to pop
I wait till Lil' Jon come on and let off a shot
I had the number one Billboard spot
Niggas stepped on my fingers and I climbed right back to the top
I'm BIG, I'm Cube, I'm Nas, I'm Pac
This ain't shit but a warning till my album drop
One blood, one blood, one blood, one blood
Blood, blood, blood
One blood, one blood, one blood, one blood, one blood
One blood, one blood, one blood, one blood
Blood, blood, blood

So I start ridin wit Fat Joe and Kiss
Made a good choice 'cause afta that Yayo bricked

My bitch said you was naked I aint see that shit
You and Olivia in the showa, my bad that was Terrence Howard
A lil Hustle & Flow and a damn coward
I had to sit there for 80 minutes
The best actor in the movie was the baby in it
This aint Newy Jack City and it cant be Menace
The worst actor in the world, you made the Guinness
I made G - Unot and that made you finished
I put two quarters in and I played you niggaz
Fuck Mobb Deep the lil thugs turned sissy
And Mase traded holy water for some Formula 50
Fuck Mobb Deep the lil thugs turned sissy
And Mase traded holy water for some Formula 50
Fuck Mobb Deep the lil thugs turned sissy
And Mase traded holy water for some Formula 50
Yall niggaz come get me, I got a glock nine
Ima window shoppa 'cause I aint got drop a dime
(Chorus)
I told you not to fuck with my gangsta,
I swear to God I told him Mase,
prayin on my downfall since I came up
Young Buck, Olivia ain't safe
i'm riding through your neighborhood with my stainless,
Yayo I'm Outside your place,
If I can't get you I'm fucking Lloyd Banks up,
You know nigga look at my face
I told you not to mess with my gangsta
I swear to God I told him Mase,
prayin on my downfall since I came up
Young Buck, Olivia ain't safe,
you told us that Ja rule was a wanksta
Yayo I'm Outside your place,
now the whole G-unit camp is in danger
It's The Game,nigga look at my face,
(1st verse)
First things first motherfucka,stop tellin them lies,
it's easy to stretch the truth now that homo died,
in front of your grandma's house,right outside,
nigga ran up on yo' shit and let off nine,
and fifty knows homocide let off nine,
you ain't die 'cause you only got shot 3 times,
1 in the jaw,two in's and out's,
he was screaming that'shy they knocked his teeth out,
I've seen your medical reports you phony homie,
look me in the eye's I tried to warn you homie,
a coward dies a thousand deaths in his vest,
i'll give you six more slug,you can add to the rest,
till' everybody from NY wanna be from the west,
kiss my converse bitch and take your last breath,
'cause that G-unit shit ain't gonna last,
you could sign Jesus Christ,he couldn't save your ass
(chourus 2x)
I took a trip to Connecticut,I was lurking with the Glock,
Mad 'cause Shot Money had me working with the cops,
You 5-0 nigga,that your name,
where I come from 5-0, that's some change,
We did background , I know you moved back some things,
but he get low like Bleek when them ratchets bang,
Mase step inside the confessional booth,
you turned your back on God,the devil got you spooked,
You ain't Murder shit,you don't even got your own block,
Takin orders from a snitch,who sleep with cops,
and Little Curtis always lookin for a scam to pull,
you ain't the real Fifty Cent,you Sam the Bull,
You got shot in the mouth once you still talkin' shit,
gap teeth in your mouth so my dick has got to fit,
now my nuts on your tonsils,my little kid is screaming G-UNOT at your concert,
(Chourus)
[Intro]
Yo Mel, they tried to kill me man,
Five Shots and I'm still here nigguh! (hahaha!)
[Chorus]
I don't give a fuck where you niggas from,
East to Westcoast I'ma bang my gun,
You better wear a vest when you come outside,
'cause niggah this's Westside 'til i die
I'm a motherfucking Soldier niggah,
I'm a Soldier niggah,
I'm a motherfucking Soldier niggah,
I'm a Soldier niggah
[Verse 1]
He signed with Dre, he gon' sell,
will he do a mil' plus or will he end up in jail?
get real close to the speaker, i got a story to tell,
he went from the front porch to the cover of double X-L
i took one in the heart, i'm ready to die
and all this hennesey'll make a nigga crash the G-5
catch me at a stop sign, niggah i ain't drunk,
i'm gangsta i pop mine leave you eye in the pump
tie you faggot ass up, let you die in the trunk,
i'm from westside compton, niggah i ain't a punk
streets is talkin, is he from cali? is he from queens?
do he ghost for P. Diddy, can he WRITE ME A sixteen?
did he take 5 shots? is he a blood or a crip?
ride through the CPT, my hood painted on them bricks
and I'ma die with a empty clip, 'cause I'm a ghetto boy
i just rap a lot like J-Prince (the boss of rap a lot)
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
In '99 i studied +The Chronic+ inside out,
a +Doggystyle+ for breakfast, lunch was +Reasonable Doubt+
I ain't know how to count bars, i was writin' on napkins(?)
high as fuck i wrote my first sixteen to +Illmatic+
I was in the hood fightin' with niggaz, over who the best MC
Ice-Cube, Snoop Dogg or Xzibit
and how the east been makin' the killin'
since them long-beach niggaz walked in new york and crushed the buildings
then this marcy-project niggah came and stole the crown,
right after the king of NY got shot down,
ten years later I'm in Harlem killin' them mixtapes,
they like me, i want them to love me like they love Mase,
but holla in LA them niggaz tell ya they hate me,
and the plan is to catch me with my gun on safety
niggah I'm still breathin', I ain't dead,
next time you try to kill me, put one in my head
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Before Jimmy Iovine the kid wasn't IV(?),
these bitch niggaz tried to take my live for five G's,
i was in the projects, two o' clock in the mornin',
playin' madden, niggaz kicked in the door and start blastin',
niggah i'm a gangsta, i don't need no pitty,
i just sit inside the ferarri and roll up a fillie
and i been compared to shyne like shyne was compared to biggie,
i'm from compton, he from new york city
come on really, you gotta be kiddin', ain't nobody biggie but biggie,
but i'm a six figi niggi, and i know Fifty,
but that don't mean i can get you backstage at awards,
or 'cause you went to highschool I'ma take you on tour,
'cause he got two bodyguards he can't get hit with the four,
and 'cause he wear a vest don't make him tupac shakur,
when you see me in the streets, ain't no security guards,
no L.A.P.D, no bullet proof cars, I'm a gangsta!
[Chorus]
Yo Dre, I thought I was dead
West coast

[The Game talking]
The young Roy Jones of this rap shit
Somebody bout to get knocked the fucked out tonight man
You better tell your boy somethin, you better tell him somethin
[Verse 1: The Game]
Skip through the blueprint one bang this what's mentioned
Bleek you're one hit away but he didn't know The Game was pitchin
Balls faster than Roger Clemens nigga you're too big for your britches
Two gold albums not make you a hitter
Might make you a little richer but don't forget the big picture
All of those make you a fag but money like Little Richard
Take your faggot ass picture put it next to Gulliany
Run you for your roc-a-wear fit and beat you with the Tommy
Drag your ass down to Alby Square
Call Beans, Jay, Freeway, Biggs, Dame I'll be there
Compton behind me ask Nas queens is with me
You ain't never sold crack in your life I'm takin your fiends with me
Come get me
My guns smoke like Robert Downey
Two shots and a pound he got a room in Kings County
And you might live or sit in a box
Depending on how long it NYPD to respond to the shot
[Chorus: The Game]
Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek
Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek
[Verse 2: The Game]
See what the problem is too much east coast dick lickin
And everybody tryin to do their best 2pac rendition
Listen they wonder how I live with 5 shots
Niggaz is hard to kill on my block
When you was in the streets comin of age
I was in the streets pumpin the gauge
While you was rappin I was makin it happen
On the block with a k
While you was with the roc on the stage
I had rocks on the stage
On headliner for the front page we know that you front
You be on sunset doin what? Gettin your punk ass stunt
You gon respect us or that fo' rippin through the vests
And you know who you are deaf nigga'll get the message
Malik or M-E-M-P-H Bleek
Fuck around and be a B-I-T-C-H sleek
'cause all that yappin dude will get guns clappin dude
And stop Memphis from rappin dude, huh
[Chorus: The Game]
Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek
Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek
[Verse 3: The Game]
It took me a little while but I am now understandin
Jay fucked up in the first round when he picked olo with candy
Did olo in the second, nigga take it from me
The Roc get knocked off the bounce till you picked up beans
Add freeway to the team but move the ugly bitch
Trade the Marcy reject for Cam'ron and Lil' Chris
Now the squad 5 is live 6 man is Neef
Fans in the stand yellin out fuck Memphis Bleek
You want beef I have your body parts all over New York
Leg in jersey arm in Brooklyn head buried in central park
You can't even borrow from New York no more like john Storch
And I ain't talkin to him I'm talkin to Malik Cox
And I got a pine box for a nigga like you
Streets is talkin how many real niggaz like you
Hit LAX remember when you come to the coast
Niggaz don't play with they lives when it comes to the toast
[Chorus: The Game]
Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek
Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek
[Intro: Game]
Ahh shit
G-G-G-G-G ... G-G-G-G-Unit
I thought all that beefin was over man
Squashed it man, been there done that
Somebody had to gon' on and fuck it up
[Game]
No more Bleek and Buddens I was hopin' for silence
Till the little sleeping beauty, went and woke the giant
This little bitch from The Luniz want beef he liein'
So I called E-40, and tried to seize the violence
I got niggaz on the island, for puttin' in stainless work
With vaseline on they palms, gettin' ready to +Bang Em Smurf+ (you little bitch)
I here him screamin' in Compton, sound like my bitch cummin'
You wasn't never fuckin' with G-Unit, quit frontin'
For domination be Lisa Leslie, a big woman
With a nine on the back, I'm gonna catch that bitch runnin'
Shove a .40 in his throat, now nigga spit somethin'
And get lost boy, go visit your big cousin
I got fish to fry, throw a line in the pacific
With cocaine on the hook, for this +Luniz+ ass nigga
You a bitch, how you call your self the Ice Cream Man
When Master P took your name and your ice cream van
Made 500 million, that's your homey though
Took your man hood, gave your shit to Lil'Romeo
This nigga, 5 foot 2, talkin' that big shit
You got +5 On It+? that money went to Chris Hicks
Tryin' to diss Too $hort for doin' his pimp shit
Nigga you been gitten fucked, swallowin' big dicks
Pac knew he was a pussy, that's why he ran south
Signed to Rap-A-Lot, they never put his ass out
Hid behind Lil' J, all the sudden you thugged out
Ran back to the Bay, sleepin' on wannabe 'cause couch
How you drop 5 albums, don't own one house
Or get the boss to call me, Banks, and fuck out
It's G-Unit bitch, let me show you what blood bout
When my blood pressure rise, I bring the bloods out
Put the barrell on his neck, blow his guts out (*gunshot)
Now that's whats you call a +Yukmouth+
[Outro: Game]

[Justo]
Word up, I be the one they call Justo if ya didn't know,
Tryin' to check my man DJ Skee,
With his new mix tape,
Pick it up ya square,
Ya heard what I'm sayin?
[Game]
It's another sad day in hip-hop,
We lost another one of my brothers,
Justo Faison,
We love you,
And we'll always miss you,
Mix tape king,
Forever...
We'll always love you Justo x4
[Verse 1]
I picked up my pen four years from the day,
Never thought I'd be rappin, or even signed to Dre,
I never been to New York, I had to find a way,
So I dropped 40 bars on a clue mix tape,
On a Birdman beat, then my name started buzzin,
Aftermaths young gun and now everybody love him,
I hooked up with Gavin, Foxy's lil brother,
He took me to K Slay and Slay put me on the cover,
Drama King I shoulda known, cause all of a sudden,
Emcees callin' my name and I'm beefin' wit Joe Budden,
That beef came and went, I got at him over Colours,
Then caught him at Def Jam, found out it wasn't nothin,
Look back at my career starin' out at the city,
Thinkin' about the biddin' war between Dre and Diddy,
If I was signed to bad boy, would 50 be on the math?
Probably not but maybe Justo wouldn't have crashed.
[Hook]
We'll always love you Justo x4
[Verse 2]
I remember when Funk Flex first heard me flow,
And Sway let me freestyle on the wakeup show,
Spit over a 100 bars then Miss Jones started to host,
That's when they started showing me love on the east coast,
Then more people found out, I was with Dre,
And at Bodega's I'm on 9 outta 10 of the mix tapes,
I'm workin' on my album and the world cant wait,
Cover of the vibe, and I ain't even have a release date,
Then I met Justo he told me if I stay hungry,
I'd go platinum and nobody can take that from me,
He joked about my rap beefs, I thought it was funny,
Gave him a pound then slid him 200 Bars and Runnin'
Went upstairs to change, got dinner at five,
Went to Houstons and that's the first time I met Nas,
Had billboard wit me and two months later he died,
So this is what it sounds like when thugs cry.
[Hook]
We'll always love you Justo x4
[Verse 3]
Markin' off days on the calendar I can't even sleep,
Like a convict, waitin' on January 18th,
When the documentary dropped, it flooded the streets,
My mix tape buzz made me gold the first week,
Double platinum in two months,
Record labels gettin' scared,
Cause the kid from Compton sellin like Sunny and Cher,
Mix tape awards came around, glad I was there,
To get my award, mix tape artist of the year,
Stepped on stage, and Justo let 'em know,
You might as well crown him the new king of the west coast,
A couple of months passed and we aint speak,
My sidekick went off (Justo Rest In Peace)
I let everybody from Snoop to Busta know,
A car crash just claimed the life of Justo,
They say the good die young, if ya know like I know,
Live ya life to the fullest one day we all gotta go.
[Game]
Give a moment of silence,
If you're wearing a Fiddy cap take it off,
If you driving, pull over to the side of the road,
We lost an underground legend,
Justo Faison,
Mix tape king,
Rest In Peace.
Three wheel motion around the corner on these niggaz, mayne
Smashin' down the block, Charlie O beat in the deck
Game, what it do?
They love the way a nigga hop them six fours and shit
The way I push buttons make them Diablo doors lift
The way I stick and move when I'm behind the wheel
Of that new Escalade with the Foreman grill
The way I peel back niggaz' jerseys
It ain't your life, I'm just not a big fan of James Worthy
So wait 'til I see y'all, I'm real surgical with the Ruger
But you won't catch my face on E.R.
But you might catch them dudes from the ambulance
Squattin' on top of ya mans givin' 'em each CPR
Tryin' to get 'em to 'Breathe Again' like Toni Braxton
Told y'all 'bout comin' to Cali, with them phony accents
Hollywood got movies but it ain't no actin'
So wear that bling to them awards like it ain't no jackers
We chain snatchers, twenty-fo' seven
Y'all, when you're on the West coast
(Eat ya beats alive)
When ya come to the lab
(Eat ya beats alive)
Fuckin' with this cash
(Eat ya beats alive)
'Cause it's all about math
(Eat ya beats alive)
When you come to the West
(Eat ya beats alive)
When ya come to the lab
(Eat ya beats alive)
All about cash
(Eat ya beats alive)
Nigga, all about math
(Eat ya beats alive)
It ain't nuttin' to spray you faggots
Or have your moms get you a Burberry suit
So you look good in that casket?
It's you faggots, desperado in tact
June, Drago, The Game and D-Mac
Come through in a grim reaper black Cadillac
Seven three, ooh wee, you see, who he
With the ugliest flows, money hungriest
Oh, the kid got hoes, you ain't know?
Head is never optional, get my whistle, blizzow
Carry pistols to your Sources and your Grammys
Of course, it's that nigga that kick down doors
And leave rooms filled with corpses, Jordan and bloody Air Forces
To get my dough I come back like Air Jordan
Same shot, lil' older, still no nigga can hold him
Stepped back, sold crack let the Compton streets mold him
Big face said I can hold it, he'll bet you a G
When you're on the West coast
(Eat ya beats alive)
When ya come to the lab
(Eat ya beats alive)
Fuckin' with this cash
(Eat ya beats alive)
'Cause it's all about math
(Eat ya beats alive)
When you come to the West
(Eat ya beats alive)
When ya come to the lab
(Eat ya beats alive)
All about cash
(Eat ya beats alive)
Nigga, all about math
(Eat ya beats alive)
See I'm the nigga with the most flow
Figgaro from killer Cali, reppin Get Low, niggaz know
Independent with my hustle
Couldn't give a fuck, money or muscle, it's time to bubble
West coast is the place where we holdin' it down
Bay area thuggin', they knowin' it now
I'm from the home of the Get Low, home of the get dough
Home where they want mo' so niggaz get they pistol
Run up in yo' back do', lookin' for the cheddar cheese
Canary wristwatch on celebrities
Diamond bezelled iced out with hella cheese
And every fuckin' link is like a masterpiece
Catch 'em slippin', comin' out the Burger King
Parkin' lot project life, we like to spark a lot
Better known as a bandit, niggaz can't stand it
My whole block gets hard like granite
When you're on the West coast
(Eat ya beats alive)
When ya come to the lab
(Eat ya beats alive)
Fuckin' with this cash
(Eat ya beats alive)
'Cause it's all about math
(Eat ya beats alive)
When you come to the West
(Eat ya beats alive)
When ya come to the lab
(Eat ya beats alive)
All about cash
(Eat ya beats alive)
Nigga, all about math
(Eat ya beats alive)
Nigga

Aftermath,

[Chorus]
Bitches only feel ya shit just a lil' bit
Niggas only feel ya shit just a lil' bit
The hood only feel ya shit just a lil' bit
Stop the singin',lets get back to some killa shit 2x)
[Hurricane Game]
Step up in the club they like who you wit,
I'm signed to Dr. Dre not G-Unit,
Red rag in my pocket, feel that old school,
You forgot how bullets feel, Im'a show you,
I'm a gangsta I do what I want to,
Your time is up nigga, I dun warned you,
You got the police with you nigga don't trip,
I got a box of doughnut's and a whole clip,
When it's time for beef he gets his drink on,
Animal Rights said kill him with that mink on,
I'ma kick it by your car till its time to go,
And I wont leave the scene til the police show 'cause
[Chorus]
Bitches only feel ya shit just a lil' bit,
Niggas only feel ya shit just a lil' bit,
The hood only feel ya shit just a lil' bit,
stop this singin',lets get back to some killa shit (2x)
[Hurricane Game]
Remember 50 comin' out your stereo,
Sounded gangsta till he switched his flow,
How many times I try to get you to hit the smoke,
Stop lying to the people you don't twist the dro,
My tech is snit my clip is long,
And the Bloods and Crips is on you door,
They must've heard that you a ho,
Got G-Unit airbrushed on your toe,
I bring the pump in the club cause I'm hurricane,
And I do these rap beefs all the time man,
They say at summer jam I turned it out,
But Kanye and Hova killed it without a doubt,
The rat came out dancing like a pro man,
Punch him in the face the crowd was like oh man,
Four months ago I was yellin' G-Unit,
Till I found out the nigga 5-0 is a snitch,
Now..
[Chorus]
Bitches only feel ya shit just a lil' bit,
Niggas only feel ya shit just a lil' bit,
The hood only feel ya shit just a lil' bit,
Stop the singin', lets get back to some killa shit (2x)

[Verse 1: Game]
Bitch don't kill my vibe, nigga don't blow my high
Wake up in a Bugatti but I'm in a Maserati when I'm on the 405
I'm king of the motherfuckin' Westside
Two dubs up when the TEKs fly (Bla! Bla! Bla! Bla! Bla! Bla! Bla! Bla!)
Turn a 600 to an S5
Compton made me direct this ending
Like my little nigga Kendrick, and props to Jay-Z
Got a Rocky pendant and a drop Mercedes
I'll be gone 'til November but I'm not from Haiti
I'm a C-O-M-P-T-O-N, N-I, double G-A
Like a young D-Wade, brought my city a championship by myself
And niggas think I'm doin' this shit for my health
I am, don't make me go HAM, 4-5
Go blam, I was just protecting my wealth
Matte black Bentley, all-black pennies
Black Tom Ford shades, I'm 'bout to go stealth
All black everything
Trap Wesley Snipes inside Tiffany's wedding ring
Nigga, never get out
I'm constipated, just tryna get my shit out
False alarm, I can't do number two
Pee on you peons for eons and eons
Used to intercept niggas, rock like Deion
Sellin' white packs out my grandmama's Neon
Ask my nigga Breon
I played Pac's brother in this classic movie
No relationship to Leon
When I spit for Dre I had a nigga forehead like a nigga was a klingon
No album out, I'm on 106 like a nigga put Free on
Any beat that I breathe on or be on, I be gone
I brawl like I'm out in Maryland, Georgetown, Michigan
Florida, watch a nigga get his UNC on
Baby Jordans for my baby daughter
No Harold Miner, can I get my USC on?
Eight cars in my driveway, sideways
Horsepower make the Lamborghini fly away
I am the shit when I step out the Six
And I step at your bitch in my brand new kicks
[?] don't act brand new
Cause you suck on my dick when you walk in my crib
Airplane mode, won't be no duck lips next to Van Gogh
Dance with the devil, I learned to tango
S on the metal, I wrapped the Range Rove
Ride to my limits inside the Infinite
God is my witness, I've got the roof in it
Designed to go win it
Mismatched rims on the motherfuckin' Phantom
Nigga, nigga on God, I'mma spend it
Compton, Westside, and I'm riding with Kendrick
[Outro: Kendrick]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
You ain't heard a chorus like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line
[Intro:]
Anybody
OKE
I need anybody
It's the moment ya'll been waiting for
Anybody I need
Anybody I need
End of school, we had a good run right?
Ha ha
[Verse 1:]
Listening to that Drake, I'm like oh shit!
This nigga Drizzy got me thinking bout my old bitch
You know what? Fuck that bitch, fuck that bitch
You got some bottles in your session, you can fuck that bitch
Jesus piece was a motherfucker,
Gotta thank God like a motherfucker
Interscope ain't promote that hoe,
But Jimmy I beast to my motherfucker
I'm back like Joe but in hefty grub
I just signed with Cash Money, yeah nigga, you know it
Spending all my motherfucker money and live like goddamn bitch
Can a motherfucker live?
Can a motherfucker live?
Can a motherfucker live?
Brand new dead, drop top Gatti
Kobin up grove, can a motherfucker live?
Flies and jet, motherfucker live
MIA buzzing like a motherfucking bee
Real nigga here, real nigga career
Body anywhere, nigga, I'm so sincere
Six bottles Ciroc, couple hoes in here
Couple old niggas from a 4-4 in here!
Nigga ain't dolo here
Got desert niggas on the niggas polo here
Bitch back back so my logo clear
It's Rich Gang! Dollar signs on the big chain
Ain't nothing new, I've been fucking with Wayne!
[Hook:]
Hanging out that window, throwing West Side up, like Pac and you know
In the club we're startin to popping off and you know
20 K, a king of diamonds, bitch, and you know
California king, hoe, just so you know
And you know,
And you know
And you know
Just so you know!
[Verse 2:]
Listening to this Big Sean like, "oh shit!"
My lil nigga Kendrick kills you on your own shit
But I fuck with Sean
It's just Compton, nigga
I helped him get his Jesus piece back from the mobsters, nigga!
I've been the middle man for rap niggas and jury niggas
Ask me find that shit like I'm motherfuckin Siri.
IPhone, ass nigga! Five homes, yes nigga!
New coupe slide back with the roof
Hunned 80 proof, gotta throw it back to proof
Air Jordan Ones, North Carolina,
I'm killing these bitches like Ray Keruf
They salute like soldiers, nigga
Give, yo game up like soldiers, nigga
Treat em like lawn chairs, throw them nigga
Still got the West Coast on my shoulders, nigga
Keep to the city, that polices is watching,
A hundred thousand on funerals
Bitches calling me Robin
Cause I'm a hood nigga, doing good, nigga!
I'm God's favorite, I wish you would nigga!

I woke up out that coma 2001
'bout the same time Dre dropped 2001
Three years later the album is done
Aftermath presents: Nigga Witta Attitude, Volume One
Rap critics politickin, wanna know the outcome
Ready to Die, Reasonable Doubt and Doggystyle in one
I feel like 'Pac after the Snoop Dogg trial was done
Dre behind that G series and All Eyez on Me
I watched the death of a dynasty, so I told Vibe Magazine
Workin' with Dr. Dre was a (dream)
I had visions of makin a classic, then my world turned black
Like I was starin' out of Stevie Wonder's glasses
It's kinda hard to imagine, like Kanye West
Coming back from his fatal accident to beatmaking and rapping
But, we the future, Whitney Houston told me that
And it's gon' take more than a bullet in the heart to hold me back
Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
Cause Martin Luther King had a (dream)
Aaliyah had a (dream), Left Eye had a (dream)
So I reached out to Kanye and (I brought you all my dreams)
(Cause I love you, I love you, I love you)
I had dreams of fuckin' a R&B; bitch like Mya
When I saw that ass on the front of that King
Read the article in the magazine, she loved gangsters, loved nasty things
So I'm in the glass house having nasty dreams
Good girls never give it up
But anything is possible, if 50 fucked Vivica
Hurdled life's obstacles, found my way through the maze
Then joy turned to pain like Frankie Beverly and Maze
Used to dream of being Unsigned Hype
'til I was crushed by Dave Mays, almost let my pen fall asleep on the page
Daydreamin' yesterday, dozin' off backstage
I thought I saw Eazy talking to Jam Master Jay
So I walked over, heard Jam Master say
"It's a hard knock life, then you pass away"
They say sleep is the cousin of death, so my eyes wide open
Cause a dream is kin to your last breath
Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
Cause Martin Luther King had a (dream)
Aaliyah had a (dream), Left Eye had a (dream)
So I reached out to Kanye and (I brought you all my dreams)
(Cause I love you, I love you, I love you)
The dream of Huey Newton that's what I'm livin' through
The dream of Eric Wright, that's what I'm givin you
Who walked through the White House without a business suit
Compton hat, jheri curl drippin on Ronald Reagan's shoes
Gave Mike Lem my demo, came here to pay my dues
Started off with Whoo Kid, then I start blazin' Clue
It was all a dream like Big said it'd be
Don't sleep on me homey, I bring nightmares to reality
Rap phenomenon, defyin' the rules of gravity
Studied all the classics, start revisin' my strategy
Cause Marshall Mathers made it, Curtis Jackson made it
Head in the clouds, wonderin' where the hell Marvin Gaye went
How do I say this? I'm livin' for my son
But I can't figure out, why I'm at my temple with this gun
Wake up to a Jesus piece like a catholic nun
The war to be a rap legend, has just begun
Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
Cause Martin Luther King had a (dream)
Aaliyah had a (dream), Left Eye had a (dream)
So I reached out to Kanye and (I brought you all my dreams)
(Cause I love you, I love you, I love you)
This song is dedicated to Yetunde Price
The sister of Venus and Serena Williams
Who was slain during a gang shootout in Compton
Sunday, September 14th, 2003 - rest in peace
Yo, when I'm out in Oakland, catch me in the silver and black Coupe
With two Desert Eagles and an ounce of glue
When I'm out in San Fran, the P.D. real nervous
'Cause they know I'm packin' heat under the Willie Mays jersey
Nigga, it ain't nuttin' for me to empty a clip
Or wave my guns in the air and just enter ya strip
I know about gangs, had shootouts with plenty of Crips
I sold crack and been out of town with plenty of bricks
So ain't nuttin' you can tell me, about the game
Come with beef and leave here without your brains
And I'ma drive upstate and try to bounce this 'caine
In that Shelby the same color as moutanin rain
And you know I got the South clickin'
'Cause ain't nuttin' like niggaz with gold teeth
And them down South chickens
So fuck with my D and get found wit'cha mouth missin'
This ain't about you and me it's about business nigga
It's business never personal, real live on blocks
If we ain't movin' the rocks, then we movin' the stocks
Cross a hustler motherfucker you'll arrive in a box
It's the true to life struggle 'til we arrive on top
It's business never personal, real live on blocks
If we ain't movin' the rocks, then we movin' the stocks
Cross a hustler motherfucker you'll arrive in a box
It's the true to life struggle 'til we arrive on top
They don't understand me, like the Birdman I got candy
Put the herb in, I got family
I'm doin' 85, in the 50 mile an hour lane
Tryin' to handle my business, the Figaro stack change
Independent tycoons, tycoons, yeah
My niggaz puff trees, snort coke and chew shrooms
Bad to the bone, to the bone
And can't trust a nigga for shit 'cause Fed's on the phone
My whole crew dirty, fuckin' with amphetamines
Catch you slippin' blow your whole crew to smitharines
Now the streets knowin', knowin'
And I'ma run this shit back with my foot broke like Terrell Owens
Still blowin'
Like Mike Jones of the Swishahouse, gold knock them bitches outs
We take trips out to Houston and D.C.
For the West coast, nigga can you feel me?
It's business never personal, real live on blocks
If we ain't movin' the rocks, then we movin' the stocks
Cross a hustler motherfucker you'll arrive in a box
It's the true to life struggle 'til we arrive on top
It's business never personal, real live on blocks
If we ain't movin' the rocks, then we movin' the stocks
Cross a hustler motherfucker you'll arrive in a box
It's the true to life struggle 'til we arrive on top
We on our third song, we on our third song, heyyeyy
You understand it, I'm official with mine I'm double clutchin'
On the fo' wheel, pushin' quarters like niggaz doin dope deals
Fo' cut 50 like a verse and a half
I cut the brick and now we countin' the math, we 'bout that birdplay
My crew's committed, you dudes gon' get it
Have a seat you through when I'm finished, my troopers is fitted
Got 'em posted out in Brooklyn, Hollis Queens to the bridge
We in the studio the Figgaro done did it again
We got factors out in the ditch where they smackin' a bitch
I got homies out in the Bronx where they bustin' at cops
It ain't no game with the underground, came from the underground
Pushin' a hundred thousand, we out the trunk, never browsin'
JT, another boss from the Bay
And rest in peace to my boy, Mac Dre, what'chu say nigga?
JT, another boss from the Bay
And rest in peace to my boy Mac Dre, motherfucker
Hey, yo, it seem to me like e'rybody got they own truth
Believe me I'm in them sheets like phone booths
I play the game I was born to score
But I'm a lil' too cute for them corner stores
A little too, known to stand on the block
And a lil' too eager to sit in the spot
Mami, I'm from the Eastside, yup yes that side
Heads fly if I open ya chest that wide
Gimme a bad vibe end up on ya backside
Or you can get your back and side splatted in back of ya ride
And I can make it happen, if I don't make it rappin'
This lump of Satan, I'm packin' thrash 'em with a major passion
I slash ya face and fracture you flashin' in the latest fashion
And have you dashin' from Manhattan all the way to Aspen
Your shit is whack, heard your tape and had to take an aspirin
Step ya game up
Listen, before I get up in the mornin' I ask the Lord for strength
Tryin' to get my niggaz out the hood, you know how the forces get
It's like the devil got a hold of my neck
And I'm gettin' this change runnin' 'round reppin' my set
Momma used to look at me funny she could tell her baby boy changed
Must be out there gettin' some money
But it's a price for everything, you know how the game go
For them birds niggaz'll cock back the calico
Now you introduced to the beef, what'chu gon' do now?
Bitch up, skid in your crib, or pull them tools out?
A lot of niggaz is real, a lot of niggaz is fake
A lot of niggaz shake your hand and shake hands with Jake
Fuck what'chu heard, I startled your brain
I hit the spot like a [unverified] in ballers and jeans
On some eighty-eight shit, more raw than Kane
It's not my fault she looked at me, you better talk to your dame
That's just, part of the game and you got served
Who got nerve cause Lethal hard like Tupac words
And, why y'all chucks always actin' like tough guys
You must be trippin' or you slippin' on mudslides
And in the hood you see it's different from one time
What's your bloodline, play the strip to the sunshine
And I don't even know why I'm wastin' my breath
I oughta be like Makaveli and be fakin' my death
I keep that good shit it's tastin' so fresh
And all y'all sloppy Joe niggaz yo y'all makin' a mess
We on the way to yo' nap, so put your tapes in the deck
And spit in a hundred bars straight without breakin' a sweat
(50 Cent)
yeah, lets take em' back, uh-huh

confusion occurs comin up in a cold world
daddy aint around, prolly out commitin' felonies

(Game)

thinkin how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes
when there's kids starvin'
pac is gone and brenda still throwin babies in the garbage

[JT]
Three wheel motion around the corner on these niggaz mayne
Smashin down the block, Charlie O beat in the deck
Game, what it do? (What it do?)
[The Game]
They love the way a nigga hop them six-fours and shit
The way I, push buttons make them Diablo doors lift
The way I, stick and move, when I'm behind the wheel
of that new Escalade with the Foreman grill
The way I, peel back niggaz jerseys
It ain't your life, I'm just not a big fan of James Worthy
So wait 'til I see y'all, I'm real surgical with the Ruger
But you won't catch my face on E.R.
But you might catch them dudes from the ambulance
Squattin on top of ya mans givin 'em each CPR
Tryin to get 'em to "Breathe Again" like Toni Braxton
Told y'all 'bout comin to Cali, with them phony accents
Hollywood got movies, but it ain't no actin
So wear that bling to them awards like it ain't no jackers
We chain snatchers (twenty-fo' seven)
[Chorus: JT]
When you're on the West coast - eat ya beats alive
When ya come to the lab - eat ya beats alive
Fuckin with this cash - eat ya beats alive
Cause it's all about math - eat ya beats alive
When you're on the West coast - eat ya beats alive
When ya come to the lab - eat ya beats alive
All about this cash - eat ya beats alive
Nigga all about math - eat ya beats alive
[The Game]
It ain't nuttin to spray you faggots
Or have your moms get you a Burberry suit so you look good in that casket
It's [reversed] you faggots, desperado in tact
June, Drago, The Game and D-Mac (holla)
Come through in a grim reaper black Cadillac
Seven-three, ooh-wee, you see, who he
With the ugliest, flows, money hungriest
Oh, the kid got hoes, you ain't know?
Head is never optional, get my whistle, blizzow
Carry pistols, to your Sources and your Grammys
Of course it's that nigga that kick down doors
And leave rooms filled with corpses, Jordan and bloody Air Forces
To get my dough I come back like Air Jordan
Same shot, lil' older, still no nigga can hold him
Stepped back, sold crack let the Compton streets mold him
Big face said I could it, he'll bet you a G
[Chorus]
[JT]
See I'm the nigga with the most flow
Figgaro from killer Cali, reppin Get Low, niggaz know
Independent with my hustle
Couldn't give a fuck money or muscle it's time to bubble
West coast is the place where we holdin it down
Bay area thuggin, they knowin it now
I'm from the home of the Get Low, home of the get dough
Home where they want mo' so niggaz get they pistol
Run up in yo' back do', lookin for the cheddar cheese
Canary wristwatch on celebrities
Diamond bezelled iced out with hella cheese
And every fuckin link is like a masterpiece
Catch 'em slippin comin out the Burger King
Parkin lot project life, we like to spark a lot
Better known as a bandit, niggaz cain't stand it
My whole block gets hard like granite
[Chorus]
[JT] Nigga
Game
Yo yayo think he hot but on the real he not, 50 think he nice but realli he lik suga and spice, buck think he the one but he onlii carry a water gun,im sick of yu niggas don mess, man fuck 50 i dont need a vest on my chest, these people think they tha shyt but wen they hear this they gon hav a fit, the underground is mine, man im gone shyne, o ye i forgot to say damnnn olivias finneee
Yo, it's the nigga with the nasty flow and the clean rag six-four
With the D's spinnin' I can bag a hoe
Top down, so my rag can show, whatever in the dutch
Purple or orange, haze, it's just a bag of 'dro
Hit snatch with my khakis on, Aladdin Lounge
In Mark Jacobs denim and Don Magli's on
I'm a gangsta and the birds they love it
20 with a babyface and sit on base like Kirby Puckett
You can't buy a Ferrari, fuck it, cop lle' from J
The bricks come with Louis Vuitton luggage
He order rock and cover it, the dimes is free
The quarters is 75, the ball is live
Ain't nobody fumblin' on my block
We in the field like Biggs or Marshall Faulk, we runnin' the rock
Nothin' less than a hundred a pop, anything less you a cop
Shoot you and take your vest and your glock, motherfuckers
What'chu know about stackin' G's, you got to come fuck wit me
Puffin' on sticky green, you got to come fuck wit me
My team is just oh, so clean, you got to come fuck wit me
What'chu know about stackin' G's, you got to come fuck wit me
I'm in the streets like the place is mine, told to cover my tracks
I push paper to increase my shine
I'm on my chief, jumpin' out the wagon like Tyco
And get the kind of paper that these niggaz'll die fo'
Bossed out, camouflage under my vest B
Motorbike, fast cars, broads and jetskis
Rule number 1, keep your eye on your cash flow
'Cause rule number 2, will get rid of your best so
None of 'em best show, ridin' in stress mode
'Less they got petrol, pushin' that Benz slow
Pick up the Game, let's count some cash
Then we, get to the do', then you put on your mask
On some other shit, ridin' wit'cha boy now
We on the West coast, seek and destroy now
It's like when Cal-Berkeley whooped on that Georgetown
We had a riot in the streets, fin' to blow now fo'sho' now
What'chu know about stackin' G's, you got to come fuck wit me
Puffin' on sticky green, you got to come fuck wit me
My team is just oh, so clean, you got to come fuck wit me
What'chu know about stackin' G's, you got to come fuck wit me
The underboss, ill too fast
Buildin' my stocks off the blocks and the wears will sag
Not Gil but tryin' to top, the nerd Bill Gates
From the city of project buildings and them Mossberg K's
San Francisco, West coast, Northern Bay, California
Man, it's Get Low so best to toast or torch'll spray on ya
Uhh, makin' mafia moves, skate from the cops
Yeah, they tried stoppin' ya dude
But nah, the ball, it don't stop
A shot callin', if I fall then my thoughts gon' flock
Yeah, underboss with Game and Doc Figgaro
Clear [Incomprehensible] and I'm the individual
Holdin' weight in the dope state
Tokin' the 8-8, oh, fold [Incomprehensible]
Watch our bread and our team skyrocket
Visualize I can rip beam on the cash and not 8 guys can't stop it
What'chu know about stackin' G's, you got to come fuck wit me
Puffin' on sticky green, you got to come fuck wit me
My team is just oh, so clean, you got to come fuck wit me
What'chu know about stackin' G's, you got to come fuck wit me
Sometimes I wonder
Man, how long is it gon' be for my people to come up
Man, we strugglin', it's hard sometimes
But tomorrow's better than yesterday
I was born in the slums, struggled from day one
Ray Charles vision, blinded by the light from the sun
No navigation, no sense of direction
Darker complexion made it hard to live
Dad, how you fathered your kids?
Stranded on the highway of life
Left us out to die, left us out to dry
Shh, I'm still hearin' my mother's cries, nigga
No father figures make harder niggaz
Through the years, went to war with niggaz
From what I saw in the picture
Now your son is bigger, thirteen, looks just like you
Mom said I would grow up and be just like you
From what you did to my sister, she disliked you
Sixteen, eleventh grade, look at me, just like you
Gunnin' for riches, runnin', hoppin' project fences
Street corners to Arizona, how I earn my digits
And I'm far from finished, gamin' till my coffee diminish
Why pray for the after life when mines just beginnin', huh
Only son by our mother, no brothers, only sisters by this one
Every time I kissed one, I missed one, let me explain
Eight years before The Game, everything came with pain
Watch the fate of my family slain would never see good times again
Cursed with pain by a nigga with no shame
My father bear the same name as his father
My grandfather wouldn't believe, he pulled up our family tree
I can see him rollin' over in his coffin'
I'm left with often thoughts of how could you molest your daughter
They say that's ten times worse than manslaughter
Man, you oughta be dead in a grave
But it wasn't my call, so instead you sat in a cage
High-powered, two-hundred and fifty pound, six-five coward
Woulda been dead in an hour
Heard you were scared to take a shower, scared of the yard
Your end is near, you shoulda been scared of God, motherfucker
Huh, niggaz think they got the game sewed, yeah right
I'm air tight, fresh in them Air Nikes
If the Navi outside, I might be there
Black hoodie, black 9, black wifey airs
Rock guns like Caddy trunks, keep a spare
You see the lump under the Iceberg fleece and gear
And when the beef cook, I'ma put the piece to your head
And if you see a white truck that mean yo' sheets is dead
Then I'm goin', goin', back, back
To the block to dump the bucket and jump in the drop
Niggaz know I'm good with the glock, they call me Chick Hearns
'Cause if the game on knot, I'm callin the shots
I'll wear a shiny suit for a minute like I'm The L.O.X.
Then get gangster with a swap meet bag and a Jordan box
And when I die, bury me with the glock and a bucket of shells
In case niggaz want drama in hell
Yeah, so when Compton niggaz
And Fillmoe niggaz get together
Shit happens mayne, real talk from ya nigga Fig'
Doin' it big and don't wanna split yo' wig
I'll give you anything you ask fo', money over bitches
Tell me what'chu blast fo'? Fuck around with snitches
What you had to smash fo' ? Niggaz tried to play me, man
Anything you ask fo', all about this Bay game
I'll give you anything you ask fo', money over bitches
Tell me what'chu blast fo'? Fuck around with snitches
What you had to smash fo' ? Niggaz tried to play me man
Anything you ask fo', representin' Bay game
I be the boy with the most cabbage, pluck strings like I'm Lenny Kravitz
I'm in the streets where they goin' savage
One, two, so we dance on the rooftop
Let the Coupe ghost ride then we come to two stops
Figga eight an' by the corner sto'
Niggarali from killer Cali, you gotta let 'em know
Yeah, ya hit me on my Sidekick
Inventory pilin' up, niggaz tryin' to buy shit
They got me diggin' in my files
Pro Tools, ADAT tapes and big sounds
Jumpin' on a plane, jumpin' out a taxi cab
Stackin' up this fettucini now these niggaz hella mad
Fuck that nigga, he got another album on the board?
Damn right, another album on the board
Fuck the bullshit, the Figgarali don't play
I represent the whole Bay every motherfuckin' day
I'll give you anything you ask fo', money over bitches
Tell me what'chu blast fo'? Fuck around with snitches
What you had to smash fo' ? Niggaz tried to play me, man
Anything you ask fo', all about this Bay game
I'll give you anything you ask fo', money over bitches
Tell me what'chu blast fo'? Fuck around with snitches
What you had to smash fo' ? Niggaz tried to play me man
Anything you ask fo', representin' Bay game
Count rubber band grands
I'm out big on the under with my fam bam
And I hover the lands
To expand, I'm from the gutter grime and the sand
No jams the flam's all busted
The dames want the bucks when they see you stuffed in
Your pockets, 'til they get them some
But testin' my pocket, only gets you none
'Cause I got a pimp mentality
The scrubs wanna eat shrimp and get my salary
They ain't knowin' I'm tight laced in my shoestrings
Hate the way I'm flowin' on the mic 'cause I do gleam
All types of baguettes and bezels
We shine like life's [Incomprehensible] rebels
2005, me and my crew just pile the pots
Move like the ice loose, pimp these thangs to watch
I'll give you anything you ask fo', money over bitches
Tell me what'chu blast fo'? Fuck around with snitches
What you had to smash fo' ? Niggaz tried to play me, man
Anything you ask fo', all about this Bay game
I'll give you anything you ask fo', money over bitches
Tell me what'chu blast fo'? Fuck around with snitches
What you had to smash fo' ? Niggaz tried to play me man
Anything you ask fo', representin' Bay game

Three minutes my nigga, y'all know what it is
JUST BLAZE!
("No more fun and games!")
Gangsta gangsta, that's already evident
Nigga Witta Attitude, check check my residence
Whether I'm Crip or Blood, homey that's irrelevant
I with the D.O.C., there's nobody better than
The West coast felon when he on that lowrider bike pedallin
Somebody tell Eazy they still yellin it
I'm wit'cha homey Doc Dre on the television
While these niggas movin peanuts like a elephant
I move cars like spinnin rims
I'm in a class all by myself like the brown Eminem
Not to down Eminem, I fuck black bitches
Fuck white bitches, nigga I like bitches
Them half-and-half Alicia Keys dyke bitches
If the head right I might Air Nike bitches
Or put 'em on the track like Just Blaze
I look down on hoes and look up to Dre
Cause ain't ("No more fun and games!")
Gangsta, gangsta! ("That's what they're yellin")
("It's not about a salary, it's all about reality")
("I ain't gotta tell you this but one mo' time..")
("Leroy!") (".. now pay attention")
I'm like Dre, Eazy, Cube, King Tee and Ren rolled in one
Used to move birdies 'til I put a hole in one
Nigga that thought I wasn't holdin a gun
And tried to ride up on me like Afeni Shakur's only son
Dre told me he ain't doin Detox, this his only run
Mase comin back, and Hov, he done
I'm surrounded by legends, sittin at the round table
I am The Game, and still niggas tryin to play dude
I'm ruthless, I ain't talkin 'bout the label
I'll hook niggas up, and I don't mean free cable
I mean I'll hook niggas up to them IV's
The same way Dre hooked me up to Iovine
I'm from the gutter, grew up in public housing
On the same block with a shack like Yao Ming
So if a nigga ever try to Jerry Heller me
Tell Dre put up a mill, cause that's what my bail'll be
Gangsta, gangsta! ("That's what they're yellin")
("It's not about a salary, it's all about reality")
("Nigga I just came out the hole, I done did my time")
("Nigga what you know about time?")
I've been rappin for one year, one month, 17 days
13 hours, 28 minutes, then I met Dre
30 minutes after I bought the new Em
That was November 18th, 3:09 PM
Around the same time, "Wanksta" got it's first spin
That was 32 weeks before they signed Rakim
Eight months, 13 days before I knew where Mike lived
And three years after Mason Betha turned his mic in
I started writin 22 months and 20 weeks prior
To LeBron shakin Adidas for Nikes
I'm right here, six years after Randy Moss
Caught his first touchdown for them Vikings
Just one day, seven hours, 14 minutes
21 seconds before SoundScan got printed
Two platinum records 'fore I'm classified with Biggie
And two seconds before the song finish, yeah
Remember me? Like father, like son
Had a million dollars 'fore I was 1
'Cause my daddy hustle
We good now
'Cause my daddy hustle
We out the hood now
'Cause my daddy hustle
Remember me? Like father, like son
Had a million dollars 'fore I was 1
'Cause my daddy hustle
We good now
'Cause my daddy hustle
We out the hood now
'Cause my daddy hustle
Winning like Steph Curry in the chip though
Used to be the only one, now I'm the big bro (I'm here too)
Know my daddy schizo, don't mess with his kids yo
Me and my brother tight (yeah), we like the Klitschkos
I love you daddy
Ten years later, I love you too sons
I do life in the box if they ever fuck with my two sons
You're my lil' man, I remember the first day you came out
Your lil' face, your big nose, your lil' feet, your lil' hands
You turned one, come in the room wobbly, lil' stance
And every time I walked in the house he used to do this lil' dance
On the cover of the album with them Chucks on
You cried for 6 hours, your mama in here going nuts on me
She said you had enough, I said we having fun
All babies cry when they're one, my career had just begun
And so did being a daddy
Car seat in my Escalade, you want me in the Caddy
Playing Like Father, Like Son, looking in the back seat
He don't look nothing like his mama if you ask me
On the first album Busta Rhymes did the hook
Now he can do it for himself, watch him and his uncle cook
Buss
I'm glad you grew up to becoming everything you could be
That's all I wanted for you young'n, like father, like son
And in the end I'm glad you only turned out better than me
I hope you know I love you young'n, like father, like son
Your daddy told you it was coming
Coming, your day was coming, I told you
Now daddy's here just keep on running
Running, just keep on running, I tell you
I wanna thank my baby mamas Tiff and Eliska for everything
Y'all deserve the world, I wasn't worthy of no wedding ring
It ain't be one day since I met you I wasn't there for you
Wasn't husband material, but you know I really cared for you
And I know you remember that time when he was 5
All these tours taking the toll, I can see it in his eyes
So I stopped tours, stopped rapping, didn't give a fuck about
Nothing that happened after recording The Doctor's Advocate
Catching up with my son, cause ain't nothing more important
Than walking inside the Footlocker, copping them matching Jordans
Helping him with his jumper, the day he turned 9
I asked him what he want for his birthday, he said to spend some time
So we kick it, that's my best friend, I don't have to get married
He still my best man, and that's forever
Anybody can be a daddy, just bust a nut and leave
But I'm a father, and I'ma be everything he need and more
I'm glad you grew up to becoming everything you could be
That's all I wanted for you young'n, like father, like son
And in the end I'm glad you only turned out better than me
I hope you know I love you young'n, like father, like son
Your daddy told you it was coming
Coming, your day was coming, I told you
Now daddy's here just keep on running
Running, just keep on running, I tell you
Every time I get in this booth
I'm reminded ten years ago I did it for you, had this vision for you
And I know your daddy get in trouble sometimes
But I'ma stay up out this prison for you, I mean
You all my seed, lil' brother and both of your sisters
You all I need like Method and MJB
And I know I be wildin' sometimes, you told me ("Breathe daddy") (1,1, 2,2, 3,3, 4,4)
Furthermore, I'm try'na stay outta trouble just for my sons
Even though it feel weird leaving my house without a gun
I just gotta do it, cause they might grow up and do this shit
Just cause they father do it, fuck with my kids and six Bloods
Jumping out a Buick, understand Puff choking that man for Jus
I'ma do my stuff even if I land in fucking cuffs
For every nigga out here without a kid
Have one and that's gon be the best shit you ever did
One
Yo Havoc, I'm too close to the edge on this one nigga
I ain't gon' jump though, I'mma keep it raw gutter
Yo Prodigy, you know I need you on this one nigga
I got shit on my chest, I must confess
Last night I was the nigga that shot up your projects
Now I'm back in the hood, with rocks in the Pyrex
Tan khakis and them Nike Airs with the dyed checks
I was forced to live this life, forced to bust my chrome
My pops left me in a foster home
I felt abandoned like Quik now that Mausberg gone
So I don't hop in the SS without the Mossberg homes
I've been rappin' for a year and a half, my life is real
Put the gun in his mouth, he gon' bite the steel
Come to Compton, I got stripes for real
Before Dre, before the ice, before the deal - I was almost killed
Like 'Pac before the Death Row deal
I got shot over two pounds of weed, still ain't found them niggas
But karma come quicker for a nigga on the other side of the gun
That's somethin I gotta teach my son
I don't need your love, no no no no
I don't need your love
Need it, I don't want it, I don't need it
I don't need your love, no I don't need your love
I don't need your love
Cause, the, game, don't, change
I heard they got Bloods in New York now
Red rags in Uptown Harlem now, I need that love
Front court at the Knicks game, new chick, French name
New car, new house, and sometimes friends change
And you don't need that love, when you G's like us
And your Jesus piece is sim-u-lar to Biggie's
And your life story is sim-u-lar to 50's
First they hate you, then they love you, then they hate you again
What the fuck do it take for a gangsta to win?
No mics, no Unsigned Hype, nigga fuck The Source
Plus them awards I don't need
And them niggas breathing the same air as me, acting like they don't bleed
We don't drive the same speed, this a Continental T
That's a case of Armadale, this a continental suite
So I'mma drown in my own sorrows
Live life, fuck tomorrow, nigga cause reality is
I don't need your love, no no no no
I don't need your love
Need it, I don't want it, I don't need it
I don't need your love, no I don't need your love
I don't need your love
Cause, the, game, don't, change
I was gassed up, Murder Inc., Roc-A-Fella passed up
Sat in Daddy's House with Black Rob and Lou and asked Puff
Now The Game's set in stone, the Franck Muller's set in stones
Dre cut me a check, I'm gone
Tryin to be the king of the streets, niggas'll wet your throne
But I got nieces to feed, two coasts to please
So I roam through the city like the ghost of E
Gotta put Compton back where it's 'sposed to be
Nothing between all my niggas that's close to me
In the streets with two fellas packing toast for me
I'm 'posed to be, got all the critics watching my pivot
On my block in the Coupe reading kites from prison
I got niggas doing life in prison
All my fallen soldiers is one of the reasons we pour out liquor
So this song is for Ms. Wallace, Afeni Shakur
And all the mothers of dead sons that went out in the war
I don't need your love, no no no no
I don't need your love
Need it, I don't want it, I don't need it
I don't need your love, no I don't need your love
I don't need your love
Cause, the, game, don't, change
I don't need your love, no no no no
I don't need your love
Need it, I don't want it, I don't need it
I don't need your love, no I don't need your love
I don't need your love
Cause, the, game, don't, change
It's that, it's that, it's that, it's that...chronic, chronic, chronic, chronic
It's that, it's that, it's that, it's that...hydrolex, drolex, drolex, drolex
It's that, it's that, it's that, it's that...Westside, Westside, Westside, Westside
It's that, it's that, it's that, it's that...Compton, Compton, Compton, Compton
It's not that I can't stop, It's that I won't stop, I make it hot (I do it)
I'll be on top, as soon as the beat drop, I'll make the whole club rock (I do it)
Lace my Air Ones up, put my gun up
I don't need that I'm riding wit Dre
Who don't love us, every hood throwin' they dubs up
Who the fuck why'all thought was comin' after Young Buck
Hip hops worst nightmare, Mr. Gangsta Rap is back in black Nike Airs
You want war, we can settle it right here
I got a squad, E-V-E and Busta Rhymes yeah
Or you could give me ya bitch, her with the light hair
Sit her next to these yellow bottles, tea right there
Matter fact I'll take you in the back
You in the hat, and you in the blue and the black
Lets have a gangsta party
Somebody lean over and tell Banks to order another case of fortys
Yo Doc give them a coke with that, wake up the west coast is back
[Chorus:]
(I can take you hiyaaaah)
Show you how that low rider bounce off the flo' - You ain't know?
(I can take you hiyaaaah)
It's the motherfuckin chronic nigga that's whatsup - roll that blunt
(I can take you hiyaaaah)
G-Unit, Shady Aftermath I'm the motherfuckin Game and
(I can take you hiyaaaah)
Like Dre did, I created a buzz without a single like N.W.A. did
From the hood -liquor- store to the state pen
This is gin and juice
The doc made the club R.O.C. without Timbaland boots
First nigga to put drolex on a Bentley coupe
You want to pimp? I perm my shit up like snoop (Westside)
Chronic 2005 motherfucker, put the purple in the dutch
"Let it Burn" like Usher girl
Drop down, do the eagle, fuck that
Real niggaz just pull up they pants and lean back girl
Make 50 spill his cris, he'll call you a bitch
I'ma call you and hit , you can ya girlfriend, we can make it a flick
I got the lollipop if you want to lick
Or you can take a ride on the magic stick
[Chorus:]
Put 25's on the hummer, why not
I'ma be here for the next 10 summers
Drop me in the 4th quarter I'm fuckin' up they money
I don't need sound scan I'm doin' my own numbers
When that impala bounce you can see the chrome under
I got em' in every color yea I'm a known stunner
When I hit a switch I get higher than long jumpers
Low ridin' with a hood rat or a grown woman
And I'll do anything but I won't fuck Mariah
Even if she had Ashanti butt naked in bed
'Cause she got a forehead just like Tyra
I can say what the fuck I want, you thought Dre retired
Left me in 6-4 his Dayton wires
These niggaz is a waste of rhymin', Doc got something to say be quiet
Look out for Detox
[Chorus:]
This is how we do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This is how we do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love
This is how we do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This is how we do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love
Fresh like, Impala,
Chrome hydraulics, 808 drums
You don't want, none
Nigga better, run
When beef is on, I'll pop that, drum
Come get, some
Pistol grip, pump
If a nigga step on my white Air, Ones
Since red, rum
Ready here I, come
Compton,
Dre found me in the, slums
Sellin' that skunk, one hand on my gun
I was sellin' rocks when Master P was sayin "Unnnh"
Buck pass the blunt
These G-Unit girls just want to have, fun
Coke and rum
Got weed on the ton
I'm bangin' with my hand up her dress like,
I'll make her cum, purple haze in my lungs
Whole gang in the front in case a nigga want to, stunt
I put Lamborghini doors on that Es-co-lade
Lil pro so look like I'm riding on blades
In one year man, a nigga's so paid
I have a straight bitch in the telly goin' both ways (Ah!)
Touch me, tease me, kiss me, please me
I give it to ya just how you like it, girl
You know I'm rockin' with the best tre pound on my hip
Teflon on my chest
They say I'm no good
Cause I'm so hood
Rich folks do not want me around
Cause shit might pop off, and if shit pop off
Somebody gon' get laid the fuck out
They call me new money, say I have no class
I'm from the bottom, I came up too fast
The hell if I care, I'm just here to get my cash
Bougie ass bitches, you can kiss my ass
This is how we do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This is how we do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love
This is how we do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This is how we do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love
I put gold Daytonas on that Cherry Six-Four
White walls so clean it's like I'm ridin on bulbs
Hit one switch mang, that ass so low
Cali got niggaz in New York ridin on hundred spokes
Touch me, tease me, kiss me, please me
I give it to ya just how you like it, girl
You now rockin with the best fo' pound on my hip
Gold chain on my chest (Ah!)
50, unh
Bentley, unh
Em came 'n gotta nigga fresh out the, slum
Automatic, gun
Fuck 'em one-on-one
We wrap up ya punk ass, stunt 'n ya done
Homie, it's Game time
You ready? Here I come
Call Lloyd Banks and get this motherfucker, crunk
It took two, months
But Fifty got it done
Signed with G-unit
Had niggas like, "huh?"
Don't try to front
I'll leave yo' ass, slumped
Thinkin' I'm a punk
Get your fuckin' head, lumped
Fifty got a, gun
Ready here he come
Gotta sick, vendetta
To get this, chedda'
Meet my Ba, Retta'
The dra-ma, setta'
Sip Am-a, retta'
My flow sounds, better
Than average
On tracks I'm a savage
I damage
Any nigga tryin' to front on my clique (G-Unit!)
[Verse 1: The Game]
June 30th, 11:07 I got that call
She 8 centimeters, my lil' man about to fall
Scuffing my Air Forces, running through the hospital hall
Deja vu, like I been here before
I'm feeling reborn, like a Bed-Stuy brethren, my first born
Dre, I'm about to have a bad boy, family in the lobby
See my nigga Church, "What Up," shit I left the camcorder in the truck
Running through the maternity ward, out of breath, sweating
I swear to God every minute's starting to feel like a second
I seen Hell staring down the barrel of a Smith & Wesson
My son's ultrasound the closest I ever been to Heaven
Lord forgive me for my sins, I know it's last minute
Put the chronic in the air, a little hash in it
Spread my wings, If only I could fly
Why fight to live homie?, If we only living to die
[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
I hope you grow up to become that everything you can be
That's all I wanted for you young'n, like Father, like Son
But in the end I hope you only turn out better than me
I hope you know I love you young'n, like Father, like Son
My little man, your day is coming, coming, your day is coming, I tell you
And when it comes, just keep it running, running, just keep it running, I tell you
[Verse 2: The Game]
They say every time somebody die a child is born
So I thank the nigga who gave his life for the birth of my son
11:32, she screaming at the top of her lungs
I'm panicking, nurse yelling for the doctor to come
All I could remember was lamaze class, breathe baby
"One (one), two (two), three (three), four (four)," I see the head
Doc busting through the door, he between the legs
He see the head, it's my baby boy
11:46, the head out, she screaming, making crazy noise
Pain is love, my stomach folding like a La-Z-Boy
I'm feeling like Mariah Carey, all these butterfly's
Voices singing to me, sound like Teena Marie
I'm calling niggas on tour, "Jayo tell ? I just cut the umbilical cord"
11:57, a soldier is born, and he's flesh of my flesh, young Harlem Coron
[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
I hope you grow up to become that everything you can be
That's all I wanted for you young'n, like Father, like Son
But in the end I hope you only turn out better than me
I hope you know I love you young'n, like Father, like Son
My little man, your day is coming, coming, your day is coming, I tell you
And when it comes, just keep it running, running, just keep it running, I tell you
[Verse 3: The Game]
I wanna thank Dr. ? and Nurse Theresa, for bringing my baby boy to life
You birthed a Caesar, And my baby Mama, Aliska
For pushing out a 10-pound, 4-ounce Mini-Me, I still can't believe it
Nose, ears, eyes, chin, just like your Daddy
I die before you grow up and be just like your Daddy, or your Grandfather
Call Uncle ?, tell him I got a son and I ain't even in Harlem
I'm popping Cris with your Godfathers, Baron Davis and "D-Mack" Darius Rogers
Drop the top on the '71, with my face in the clouds, Lord spare my son
And watch over Aaron Wright, T'Yan and Lil' Pun
Lowriding, banging "Ready to Die," track number 1
If I bust 5 times and they never see the sun
My life is a black hole, like the barrel of a gun, one
[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
I hope you grow up to become that everything you can be
That's all I wanted for you young'n, like Father, like Son
But in the end I hope you only turn out better than me
I hope you know I love you young'n, like Father, like Son
My little man, your day is coming, coming, your day is coming, I tell you
And when it comes, just keep it running, running, just keep it running, I tell you
I hope you grow up to become that everything you can be
That's all I wanted for you young'n, like Father, like Son
But in the end I hope you only turn out better than me
I hope you know I love you young'n, like Father, like Son
My little man, your day is coming, coming, your day is coming, I tell you
And when it comes, just keep it running, running, just keep it running, I tell you
Beast on the loose and my stomach is rumblin'
These niggas out here is food for my stomach
Get the fuck out the way when the lions is comin'
The elephant's stompin', gorillas is jumpin'
The snakes full of venom, the wolves out and huntin'
In this concrete jungle, in this concrete jungle, woo
In this concrete jungle, in this concrete jungle, woo
I sink in my teeth cause these niggas is sweet
Predator to the prey, you should pray for the weak
Spray out Caprices, drive by with the reaper
I hang out the window like I'm an AC
Bodies turn cold after losing your pulse
Turn that dude to a ghost like the homie SP
Yeah, from the LAX with these bars I keep locked
Ain't a prison, I'm free, I can rap in my sleep
Dude on the post with rocks using shots
They come back to your ass like an offensive rebound
Funeral home on the speed dial
When God call your number
Man, trust me, there won't be no re-dial
We out here every day, they acting senile
Year of the wolf, niggas 'bout to hear me out
This beat I'mma wreck while these gorillas beat on their chest
West swing, I'm knocking their trees down
So go in your temple
These niggas is dinner from January all the way to December
Shouldn't have played with my killers
Beast on the loose and my stomach is rumblin'
These niggas out here is food for my stomach
Get the fuck out the way when the lions is comin'
The elephant's stompin', gorillas is jumpin'
The snakes full of venom, the wolves out and huntin'
In this concrete jungle, in this concrete jungle, woo
In this concrete jungle, in this concrete jungle, woo
Real trill nigga with a hip hand trigger
I'm surrounded by the killers, I just got it like that
Rappers always talking, you ain't 'bout it like that
Coward out the hood to get it then I brought it right back
Blood money rider, keep the chopper right beside 'em
FMN fully loaded, that's for any nigga want it
This sound like I got the shit, but fact it don't it
Grab a cork, get to sparkle, talking like one of my opponents
Rate these haters above 'em
You talk some cash when you talk to me
I ain't got no love for you if you ain't getting guwop with me
All my niggas from day one gwho I'm gon take to the top with me
And this shotty on me, got the boy, I walk this so [?]
I was raised in the wild with them lions and tigers
Nothing but paper excited us, bitch we were born be riders
And I'm from BME, the G in me won't let me back down
Underground king without a crown, how I sound
(We gangsta daddy!)
[Sean T]
Yuh!
I'm sippin on that 'notiq the color of Hulk man
And the blueberry smoke got a nigga twerkin
You niggaz is perkin - so you doin it big?
You roll deep but when I see you it's just you and your kids
I roll sick, my rims feel like helicopter propellers
And my pockets run deep like a Mercer teller
Haters trip when they see the whip dippin by
The paint on it change like the I-95
I'm just Clyde, without the Bonnie, I got the hollowpoint
heat for you niggaz and the po' for the mamis
Sean Gotti, I'm puttin an end to camraderie
I'm lettin off heat, 'til them eyes get watery
Some gon' ricochet, some gon' hit, y'all gon' get 'em
Fluids gon' disperse out like refreshin club serum
I'm deadly as bite venom but I'm far from a snake
I'll hit you up on your birthday while you cuttin your cake
[Chorus: The Game]
We gangsters nigga; you see the cars, the whips
The chains, the fuckin broads we with
We gangsters nigga; we'll come through your hood
a hundred deep and empty the whole clip
We gangsters nigga; we got guns for the beef
And my niggaz'll put you under the street
We gangsters nigga; so you better watch what you say
'Fore I empty the whole glock in your face
[Sean T]
Streets is tough, but ain't no hopscotch lines on the ground
Just burner shells, and police siren sounds
Niggaz know who I am in the town; it ain't a circus
But it might as well be, cause you know I'ma clown
I'm a terrain boss, I know most niggaz envious dawg
And if a nigga owe me change you better give me it dawg
If you feelin like you wanna leap, make like a frog
You niggaz lame, transparent like Wonder Woman's plane
I'm a stunna in this game, a federal figure
Blowin doj' in the hummer, 50 K on my fingers
I'm like a NASCAR winner poppin Mo' and Bill{?}
D-Squad don't give a fuck about nobody else
I pull a {?} to contain your whole, clique for hours
The end result will probably be, pinewood and flowers
So I'll advise you deduct your QP's and powder
We gangsters and we jackin cowards (yup!)
[Chorus]
[Sean T]
S.T. nigga D-Squad, G.G.D
Don't get it twisted motherfucker yeah we do creep
We ride out thug, shit we don't die
We lay low like mechanics tryin to fix up rides
A lot of cats say I'm sick in the head, when I anger it's on
Poodles gon' be up missin or dead
I chop haters up, like an old-ass sample
Or creep through your village, like Stallone in "Rambo"
I'm like piranhas on red meat, I'm on you niggaz
You afros? Then I guess I got to comb you niggaz
So break bread, when you see me dawg hit the flo'
I'm like a nigga off the X, unpredicta-ble
Imitators always hollerin how gangsta they is
But got about as much courage as the Lion in "The Wiz"
Shit I'm into pullin shanks on you fake Jake cats
Me and my burner hold it down man we go way back
[Chorus]
Yeah, let's take 'em back
Uh huh
Comin' up I was confused, my mama kissin' a girl
Confusin' occurs, comin' up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committin' felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing ch-check out my melody
I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope
Four-four fingering, one of them gold ropes
Nanna told me if I pass I'll get a sheep skin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'll be dope
Tossed and turn in my sleep that night
Woke up the next mornin' niggas done stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothin' good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could
Hate it or love, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me
Hate it or love, the underdog's ontop
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me
I told Dre from the gate, I carry the heat fo' ya
First mixtape song, I inherited beef fo' ya
Gritted my teeth fo' ya, G-G-G'd fo ya (G-Unit)
Put Compton on my back when you was in need of soldiers
At my last show, I threw away my NWA gold
And had the whole crowd yellin' free Yayo
So niggas better get up outta mine
Before I creep and turn ya projects into Columbine
And I'm rap's MVP
Don't make me remind y'all what happened in D.C.
This nigga ain't Gotti, he pretend
Mad at us, cause Ashanti's got a new boyfriend
And it seems your little rat turned out to be a mouse
This beef shit is for the birds and the birds fly south
Even Young Buck can vouch, when the doubts was out
Who gave the West Coast mouth to mouth
Hate it or love, the underdog's ontop
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me
Hate it or love, the underdog's ontop
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me
From the beginnin' to the end
Losers lose, winners win
This is real, we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in
Is full of pressure and pain
I thought it would change
Its stayin' the same
How many hidden bowls is with'cha ya
When you had that little TV you had to hit on to get a picture
I'm walkin' with the snub, cause niggaz do a lotta slick talkin' in the club
Till they coughin' on the rug, ain't never had much but a walkman and a bud
My role model is gone, snortin' up his drug, bad enough they want me to choke
My boy just got poked in the throat, now its a R.I.P. shirt in my coat
Now I'm speedin' reminiscin', holdin' my weed hit never listen
If I see him then I'ma lift'em and maybe that'll even the score
And if not, then it'll be me on the floor
Hate it or love, the underdog's ontop
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me
Hate it or love, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me
I started out at fifteen, scared as hell
I took thirty off a pack and I made them sell
As a youth, man I used to hustle for loot
With that little deuce deuce and my triple fat goose
Sippin' easy Jesus rockin' the leases
My mama whipped me when she found my pieces
I look back on life and think God I bless
We the best on the planet so forget the rest
You know I'm still nice with my cook game
Look man, its a hood thing that's why I'm loved in Brooklyn
I handle mine just like a real nigga should
If I do some time, homie I'm still all good
Let me show what a thug bout born to die
I took the bullets outta 50, put 'em in my four five
And I ain't even got my feet wet yet
A seven figure nigga who ain't seen a royalty check
Hate it or love, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me
Hate it or love, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me
Yeah! What is it? It's Young Menace and the Game
Stackin' chips, G-Unit, doublin' down on who?
Sacramenton's finest from Sac-Town to Compton, you dig?
Yo, yo, now ain't no tellin' what the Game'll do, listen dawg
I blow the guts out the dutch and do the same to you
And just to get shit crackin', I drop the toaster
Grab the Louis, go Sammy Sosa
And you ain't gotta know me to know that
I hop out a new pink Rolls
With the fifty-two, Pete Rose throwback
Haze in my eyes, listen to Bobby Womack
On the same corner where Eazy-E sold Coke at
And dawg, I'ma test your education
What do I mean when I say I move more birds than migration?
I'm the nigga that'll smoke the purple, get high as a kite
Down half the Goose then choke your workers
Don't make me put two in your shirt, dawg, I put in the work
Then move bags like Doony & Bert
And stuff work in the GMC 'cause on my block
I'm the King of Rock like Run-DMC, nigga
I'm a mobster, with a mac-11 chopper
That'll pop ya and put one through ya motherfuckin' collar
I'm a mobster, Robin Hood's like Kevin Costner
If ya fuck with my dollars, I'll make you swallow my daughters
I'm a mobster, I keep a bitch by my waist
Just in case I gotta draw down to get this big face
I'm a mobster, I'm a mobster
I got a lot to say
Dawg, I gotta get paid that's why I rock the lle'
And chop the lle' to push bricks through your block a day
I'll bring terror to your squad and make you rock away
Don't depend on tomorrow, you can get shot today
I'll spit acid on your turf and watch your block decay
Dawg, I spit on your grave and fertilize you too
I hit 'em hard with 16 bars, flames and fumes
Somebody needs to push your infant rap back in the womb
Go 'head and keep talkin' that shit and get your life consumed
I put a hole in your chest, dawg, the size of the moon
Yeah, you musta been talkin' how'd you get out that soon?
I got a chop that'll touch yo' head like Vidal Sassoon
You don't wanna see my platoon, I got gorillas and baboons
That won't hesitate, they gon' do what they have to
When there's beef on the streets, it's on for life like tattoos
I'm a mobster, with a mac-11 chopper
That'll pop ya and put one through ya motherfuckin' collar
I'm a mobster, Robin Hood's like Kevin Costner
If ya fuck with my dollars, I'll make you swallow my daughters
I'm a mobster, I keep a bitch by my waist
Just in case I gotta draw down to get this big face
I'm a mobster, I'm a mobster
It don't matter what season, don't matter not a day
I move traffic through the city, plus, I keep the right of way
I'm on point like Bibby, I'm the leader of the team, mayne
Got the whole city amped just like a Lakers versus Kings game
Everybody's fired up, I drop major packages
I'm never doin' bids because my game is so immaculate
The bitch try to snitch, "I can't deny it" like Fabolous
Before the evidence gatherin', someone's in an ambulance
Now, that'll learn you to keep your big mouth shut
Those with big mouths, I got the perfect size nuts
Yeah, I do my dirt but I wash my hands thoroughly
Handle my business first so I can celebrate early
It's business before pleasure, my business brings me pleasure
It feels good to be able to shine in any type of weather
That's why I do what I gotta do so my money's lookin' tight
Whether I'm jukin' on the block or have bitches hookin' lights y'know?
I'm a mobster, with a mac-11 chopper
That'll pop ya and put one through ya motherfuckin' collar
I'm a mobster, Robin Hood's like Kevin Costner
If ya fuck with my dollars, I'll make you swallow my daughters
I'm a mobster, I keep a bitch by my waist
Just in case I gotta draw down to get this big face
I'm a mobster, I'm a mobster
You can catch five or catch me in the C.L.5
Whatever way dog, the game get live
Keepin' it gangsta in a P.D. city velor
Late night, I'm in Dublin's and I got myself a four
The hood love me, hood rats gotta hug me
Pop ex, spark the buba, the shit get ugly
Rock the mic anywhere and I ain't talkin' 'bout a concert dog
Talkin 'bout ten niggaz in converse dog
Get it crackin' like we out in the yard and the warden's watchin'
Only difference is the whores is watchin'
Still love to see a nigga, roll up on 20's
Hop in that six-four, roll up on Bentley's like
I'm a gangsta bay-bee, from the C.P.T.
Run with the pound like I'm from D.P.G.
If it's beef, you C-Murder like it ain't no limit
And I represent the P like Russell Simmons
I'm a neighborhood superstar, get it, right
Got it? Good, okay

Please believe that I keep two G's in my jeans
Two gats in my sleeve, two rats in my beam'
X-5, mami let's ride
Weave in and out of traffic from Compton to Bed-Stuy
It's the kid from the far west I, oh, shit
He know how to do more than flip pies
Get money like them stick up guys
Them "Ocean 11" licks got the young kid rich for life
And I talkin' 'bout a movie or George Clooney
I'm talkin' 'bout, runnin' in your spots with uzis tucked in the Coogi
Dude me? Naw truly, might lose your lives

The trey with the Broccoli with my handles on the Kawasaki
Handle my jewels with the cuff in my shoes
A.D. jacket on my elbow, 50 coast the jewels
In my neighborhood, I'm young Bill Gates, never shuffle the cake
So cover my face and run up in the place
I'm a superstar, dick and my chain, glass bezel and bang
80 karats on my pinky and rang
Crews buzz when you speakin' my name, 'cause I'm deep in the game
With top cool thangs and million dollar planes
I'm a maniac, young boy gone, like a young Roy Jones
You ought of my zone and ain't nobody home
In my neighborhood, produce stars, stakes is high
Now we soarin' through the spacious skies
Drop yo' body with them cakes and ride, the handle is up
Switchin' gears with the pedal and ride

[Verse 1]
To all my niggas on the porch getting their hair braided
Corn rolled by a L.A. bitch
And I can't forget
My niggas riding the train Yankee fitted
Thermals under that Pelle shit
I love New York but gangbanging that's L.A. shit
And I'm proud of it
Spit it through the wire so the crowd love it
Haters you know who you are you can turn it down fuck it
I can shoot a video to it and spend half the budget
I'm gangsta, let the .40 cal blow in public
More hatred inside my soul than Pac had for Delores Tucker
Every time one of my niggas get shot the more I suffer
Cause we trapped inside a world where your forced to die for your colors
I seen it all through the Range tints
Got niggas doing life in the state pen
So I dread like Jamaicans
If I die for one of my statements
Than break up the streets of Compton and spill my blood in the pavement
[Hook]
Believe me niggas keep sayin they gon heat me up
Talking that shit like they goin lay me down
And then I come through strapped to see what's up
Niggas really don't want no parts of me pal
Niggas keep sayin they gon heat me up
Talking that shit like they goin lay me down
And then I come through strapped to see what's up
Niggas really don't know parts of me pal
[Verse 2]
Who I gotta talk to who I gotta write
I want my unsigned hype
Like Kanye want his five mics
Aiight, I handle bars you ain't gotta ride a bike
To peep game and his skill here go some training wheels
Let's roll
Through the city of god
Where LA niggas train to kill
Chop you up hundred times worse than the Haitians will
For real naw Pharrell I need a track homie
Dre we to close aint no turning back homie
Deal with it I'm a be here for ten years
Spittin like the ghost of Eric Wright and Big yeah
Let me paint this picture
While you sit here thinking in the back of your mind this is the shit yeah
I spit for you niggas doing 25 on they 5th year ready to throw a nigga off the 5th tier
Them white boys in the Abercrombie and Fitch gear
And every nigga who ever helped me get here
[Hook]
Believe me niggas keep sayin they gon heat me up
Talking that shit like they gon lay me down
And when I come through strapped to see what's up
Niggas really don't want no parts of me pal
Niggas keep sayin they gon heat me up
Talking that shit like they gon lay me down
And when I come through strapped to see what's up
Niggas really don't know parts of me pal
[Verse 3]
One brick, two brick
The boy moving weight
Now three bricks, four bricks
I'm driving upstate
Five Bricks, six bricks
The nigga got cake
Not rap money, but money been rap since '88
Look at the world we live in
Niggas steady hate, to the heckler at Koch
Leave him chopped up like freddy's face
Niggas catching feelings
Cause I'm about millions
And outta all the newcomers out, my flow's the illest
You a close second nigga,
A banana to a guerilla
Put us in the same cage and I'ma have to peel 'em
The best of both worlds
Rapping and drug dealing
Run and tell the chief I came to burn down the village
The head honcho, staring out the third story window
Of my Beverly Hills condo
With two long ass heats
I call 'em Shaq and Alonzo
You niggas want me outta L.A.
Yeah I know
[Hook]
Believe me niggas keep sayin' they gon' heat me up
Talking that shit like they gon' lay me down
And when I come through strapped to see what's up
Niggas really don't want no parts of me pal
Niggas keep sayin' they gon' heat me up
Talking that shit like they gon' lay me down
And when I come through strapped to see what's up
Niggas really don't know parts of me pal
I'm coolin' in LA
The place where stars are born
And it ain't never cold outside
Because the rain will never stop
And the stars ain't only in the sky
Because the stars lay on the floor
And I-I-I-I, I got the city on lock if you wanna explore
And baby I been coolin' in LA
Pull up to the Rosco's
Only guy here, cause niggas from here
Know you gotta swerve around the potholes
Eatin' chickens with these chickens, politicin'
We gon' get a new team or not
They up and down like Impala switches
All these girls got extensions, even with the long hair
Everybody trippin', we mix Ciroc with Patron here
Don't walk around alone here, everybody from a gang
Niggas ask you where you from
That mean you gotta run that chain
Smokin' on that purple rain
We only smoke a certain strain
Soon as you call twice nigga
Welcome to the circle maine
Catch me off of rodeo, Alamita, Figueroa
Whoop these rappers ass, they all bums nigga, skid row
And I ain't dissin' homeless people, I be down there feedin' niggas
100 days, 100 nights, we killin' for no reason nigga
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, look at me in my Impala
In LA
The place where stars are born
And it ain't never cold outside
Because the rain will never stop
And the stars ain't only in the sky
Because the stars lay on the floor
And I-I-I-I, I got the city on lock if you wanna explore
And baby I been coolin' in LA
La-la-la-la-la-la
Baby when you comin' to LA
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
I'm from that big blue raggin', tip toe taggin'
Mustard and mayonnaise, with (?) on the wagon
Brown paper baggin', baby mama naggin'
(?) the skinny jeans, gucci (?) straight saggin'
Pleasure of, and agony, black jeans Cagney
The wood is the wood, but the hood is like a cavity
So much tragedy, rarely see clarity
I'm like a (?), charity, sincerely
Los Angeles, scandalous, handle us how?
We the ones you get your swag from, write that down
Home of the green leaf, watch out now
High school lesson, y'all can drop out now
California highway, California my way
I do it that way, then roll a fat jay
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, look at me in my Cadillac car
In LA
The place where stars are born
And it ain't never cold outside
Because the rain will never stop
And the stars ain't only in the sky
Because the stars lay on the floor
And I-I-I-I, I got the city on lock if you wanna explore
And baby I been coolin' in LA
La-la-la-la-la-la
Baby when you comin' to LA
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
I got LA poppin', cars be hoppin'
No refreshing these hoes, they keep shoppin'
Sunset droppin', chicken heads flockin'
No recess, my flows, there's no stoppin'
DeLorian rollin', pockets stay swollen
Drive down to (?), East Los is where I'm goin'
Cholo swagger, qe pasa wassup?
I'm rockin it, (inhale?)
LA native, LA Raider, LA Rams, motherfucken' traitors
LA Clippers, LA Lakers, trippin' off Kobe, you the motherfucken' greatest
LA Dodgers, finger to the Padres
East Los niggas sayin' chinga to madres
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, look at me in my fancy car
In LA
The place where stars are born
And it ain't never cold outside
Because the rain will never stop
And the stars ain't only in the sky
Because the stars lay on the floor
And I-I-I-I, I got the city on lock if you wanna explore
And baby I been coolin' in Compton
(Compton, Compton, Compton, Compton, Compton)
It's time to blackout, time to spit this crack out
Niggas been fiendin' for this shit, aftermath (?), crackhouse
The way I spit, niggas'll think I pulled the mack out
I said the way I spit, niggas'll think I blew J-Lo back out
Still Compton nigga, fuck y'all thought I went on vacation?
Same nigga that used to break in houses and steal PlayStation's
I hate waitin'
I told Dre to put out Detox, or I'ma do it
This is that nigga, The Chronic mixed with embalming fluid
Bring your chin here blood, so I can put this lama to it
Disrespectful nigga, see this window? I see ya mama through it
Do it for the coast, so we can toast to it
Who showed you all the Pirus? The SA's and how the Los do it?
Similar to how the vice lords and folks do it
You remember (?), I'll rest, I'm the closest to it
Put on for my city bitch cause I'm supposed to do it
Straight outta Compton, I'm the fucken movie poster to it, nigga
Aight
Now, everybody wanna know the truth about a nigga named Game
I come from the hub and every ghetto ain't the same
A lot of people already know exactly where it's at
'Cause it's the home of the jackers and the crack, Compton
Yeah, that's the name of my hometown
I'm goin' down in the town where my name is all around
And niggaz just be hatin' and shit, that's a pity
But I ain't doin' nuttin' but claimin' my city
See my lyrics are double or nothin' provin' to suckers I can throw 'em
Pass the natural ten to four and six-eight before I go
Not really into freestylin' or tryin' to promote violence
But they gotta know about the five-five-fo', so
And that's how I'm livin', I do as I please B
A young gangsta put in work on these Cali streets
And everybody knows that you gotta be stompin'
If you're born and raised in Compton
Born and raised, born and raised
Born and raised, born and raised
Born and raised in Compton
Born and raised, born and raised
Born and raised, born and raised
Born and raised in Compton
Now, Compton is a place, where all my niggaz chill, dog
'Til I found out the streets get real dog
'Bout a year ago, somebody musta wanted me to die
'Cause they kicked in the door and gave the young kid five
They musta thought that I was gon' play the bitch role
'Cause I lived through fo' five six holes
But I ain't goin' out like no fagot-ass clown
They found, they couldn't keep a gangsta nigga down
So, here's the burner in your face, motherfucker, silly sucker
Ass clucker now you're duckin' cause you can't stop
A Y.G. gangsta 'cause I'm true to my game
You're lame, and thangs ain't gon' never be the same
'Cause a nigga like the Game is takin' over
I really don't think I should have to explain
Oh yeah, I'm a dog but my name ain't Rover
And I'm the kinda nigga that's feelin' no pain
Sometimes I have to wear a bulletproof vest
Because I got the CPT style written across my chest
A gangsta motherfucker never ceasin' to impress
My name is Young Game, so you can fuck, the rest
I'm comin' like this and I'm comin' directly
'Cause niggaz gettin' all stirred up, I'm doin' damage quite effectively
Rhymin' is a battle zone and niggaz can't win
'Cause I'm a gangsta from the C O M P T O N
Keep on trying,
You can never hold me down (you can't hold me)
You can never hold me down (you can't hold me)
You can never hold me down (you can't hold me)

-ITA I would love for Rob to be on Graham Norton. His show is amazing - love that all the gutess come out at the same time and actually get to interact with each other and the guest is actually allowed to talk. American shows are all about the host and the stupid monologue. The guest gets a few minutes to answer incredibly stupid questions and show a clip. Although, I would love to see him on Craig Ferguson's show, the two of them together would be hilarious!!
[Chorus:]
I keep 3 heats on me: 45, glock and a gauge.
LeBron James, Chris Bosh and D-Wade.
Any nigga try to stunt, get sprayed.
What happened to the body?
Nigga M.I.A.
[Verse 1:]
Swear a nigga stunting but I do this every day.
Had them hoes bouncing on my dick like a Chevrolet.
Put on for my city nigga city on my face.
And I'm 'bout to throw a party.
Tell Diddy send a case.
Fuck a square nigga I say it to his face.
Rat niggas quick to tell like a snitch nigga race.
My nigga Frank told me take your time baking cakes.
Gotta get to the money at a Indiana pace.
Nigga say they gon' rob me.
Bitch you can miss me.
Stay strapped up like I'm 51, 50.
More gauge than the motherfucking pitcher.
Get your ass smoked like a swisha.
[Chorus:]
I keep 3 heats on me: 45, glock and a gauge.
LeBron James, Chris Bosh and D-Wade.
Any nigga try to stunt, get sprayed.
What happened to the body?
Nigga M.I.A.
[Verse 2:]
In that metal, where you headed nigga?
To the fucking gun range.
Fuck the paper nigga, shoot the whole fucking gun range.
Yelling out to cops soowoo here I come Wayne.
Bail only 100 thousand, nigga that's your change.
Back on deuces, fronts on dubs.
Got a Bentley and a phantom bet this bitch don't rub.
When you worth 20 mil, you can shine when it's sunny.
Just turned 30 so I can't be from Young Money.
It's Young Money and it's your money.
Niggas from the group then there's niggas wit your money.
Hating on a real nigga cos he old and you not.
Cut his hair, got some tats now he think he Tupac.
Nigga pulled up at the club tryna floss.
Boy done grew a beard now he think he Rick Ross.
Say he selling birds can't tell what it cost.
How the fuck you gon' get a chicken off.
[Chorus:]
I keep 3 heats on me: 45, glock and a gauge.
LeBron James, Chris Bosh and D-Wade.
Any nigga try to stunt, get sprayed.
What happened to the body?
Nigga M.I.A.
[Verse 3:]
Nigga sold 10 million now they say I'm Hollywood.
If I sell 10 more, shit I prolly would.
I done drove every car, I done sold every drug.
Fucked all the hoes, popped every bottle in the club.
Hoes tryna give me pills bitch I ain't into drugs.
Coconut Ciroc by the case gimme groupie love.
Grammy nominated, ain't forgot 'bout the stove.
Paint the phantom all red call that bitch Derrick Rose.
In and out of lanes, 24s insane.
Just to think I got this far from selling cocaine.
I'm a stand up nigga get your grands up nigga.
Take your ass to staples get your rubber bands up nigga.
Made all this fucking money what the fuck I'm gon' cop now.
I don't know but I'm coming through wit the top down.
Too much to live for my sons and my daughter.
One more and I'ma catch up to Tha Carter.
[Chorus:]
I keep 3 heats on me: 45, glock and a gauge.
LeBron James, Chris Bosh and D-Wade.
Any nigga try to stunt, get sprayed.

Real recognize real, I mean, game recognize game (Hiccups)
You know what it is
Goddamn you Don Julio
[Verse 1:]
That bitch fine. What you think?
Get that hoe drunk drop a blue pill in her drink
Or should I give her a green one like Em gave me
Shit had me in Detroit feeling like Jay-Z
Looked in the mirror, my lips and my nose was big
And my girl walked by wit a gold wig dancing like Beyonce
I must be dreaming
Spot on my sweatsuit, it must be semen
Cuz I jack off, every time I think of Beyonce
She took the wig off now she look like Kanye's...ex chick
I swear nigga when I get sober I ain't fucking wit this X shit
It makes me wanna sing like T-Pain
Make me wanna pierce my lip like Lil' Wayne
Make me wanna fuck yo bitch, like LUDA
Don't worry about me man
[Chorus:]
I'm off this ecstasy
And this Hennessy's got me going (Going)

Going to the sky, (sky) Sky, (sky) Sky, (sky)
Going to the sky, (sky) Sky, (sky) Sky, (sky)
Going to the Sky
[Verse 2:]
Lemme tell you why I'm fucked up
My moms and my pops had dumb luck
See she was 18, wanted to fuck wit that nigga
Pops sold heroin so he was that nigga
Carry the .45, and he bust that trigger
Ain't nobody in Compton touch that nigga
But that was back then, so fuck that nigga
My childhood weren't shit, so fuck that nigga
I been shot, been to jail. Rode around Compton on spreewells
Moved to the 'hood and still choke yo ass out like Sprewell
Still crack distribute, what you want nigga?
Wholesale, retail.
I know you faggot ass cops on detail
Look at 'em tryna hack into my geemail
All they found was old Dr. Dre beats, well
[Chorus:]
I'm off this ecstasy
And this Hennessy's got me going (Going)
I'm so high
I'm off this ecstasy
And this Hennessy's got me going. (Going)
Going to the sky, (sky) Sky, (sky) Sky, (sky)
Going to the sky, (sky) Sky, (sky) Sky, (sky)

[Verse 3:]
Like the vodka
But when I'm fucking wit Diddy, I'm Ciroc'ing
I take a back wood, gut it out
See a picture of Halle Berry I cut it out
Yeah nigga she fine! But not like she was in Boomerang
Now she (OK) like OJ and Gucci Mane
And like them I was rapping and trapping
Kept half a brick in the back of my momma Acura
Gimme a test. Hit the question
How many O's in a brick I ace that shit
Brick come through the door, taste that shit
Chop it, bag it, let 'em free base that shit
She ain't tryna fuck I Ma$e that bitch
Take her cosmo, and lace that shit
I get pussy for free I aint take that shit
I don't know if I rate that bitch
[Chorus:]
I'm off this ecstasy
And this Hennessy's got me going (Going)
I'm so high

(Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't)
(Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't)
Come on and wake up baby
I know you're sleepin'
But Daddy's home now
Pictures getting old
My little girl lookin' grown now
Your mom said you're talkin' on your own now
Walkin' on your own now.
Runnin' across the kitchen floor
Hidin' them baby dolls I sent you from on tour
And I missed you when I was tourin'
Smiling at them baby pictures
So happy, tears pourin'
God, how could something so beautiful come from me
After the gunshots, thought you was done with me.
But I know why I'm livin' now
Why you made me put the guns down,
Pick up the mic, start rappin' for a livin' now
My sun, my moon, my stars, my Earth,
My wind, my fire, my life, my baby
Tryin' to make your moms wifey but she crazy
Fussin' me, fightin' me
I know she love me 'cause you look just like me
The day you came into this world, I was so excited
Eleven twenty-one double zero
My baby girl is here
(Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't)
(Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't)
Yo, yo
You see this rap shit, I do it for you
And the first time I heard your voice
I prayed to God it had to be true
Got a son now.
Cuttin' the game, stoppin' the bullshit
Remember arm your enemy
Then you pull quick
Dipped out Cali,
Came back snatched my son
My girl's moms and I moved out Maui
Yeah yeah Pops gone bananas
See why I win her
Bigger house, wider yard, Navi with the crash bar
Pumpin' her, shifty you stupid
You ain't no dad, nigga
Takin' your black ass to court for all you have nigga
You see me and your moms that's another topic
Ain't no whip in this world with a price that you can't cop it
Stop it
Impress with wine, you didn't hear me right
It's a lesson to this song, I'm trying to steer you right
Just remember your father taught you to go hard or go home
Never sing that sad song
Don't cry
(Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't)
(Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't)
They ain't gon' preach to you,
I'mma let your mom school you
Don't let the streets fool you
Streets straight through you
That's why I'm talking to you
You see these niggas out here have you stressin' by the hour
Never turn your back on your foes
Them dudes cowards
Some days sweet and some sour
But we gon' make it together
The world is ours and you're my flower
If it's ice, you can get that
Model chicks, hit that
Never stress about the downfall
Just 'bout to get back
And I'm not saying sex is wrong
Just make sure you strap a condom on
And never ever do it in your mother's home
Never call a girl a bitch,
Show respect son
Pop your collar
Ain't nothing free
Scrape the block for every dollar
I'm gonna leave you with this my little angel
Daddy loves you
How I'd die for you, cry for you, ride for you
Switchin' handles like you breakin' the zone
Candy paint and power
On the golden bridge, bouncin' on chrome
(Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't)
(Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't)
[Chorus]

Walking through the club with a pocket full of change,

Breakfast club
I want to welcome everybody to the muthafuckin rap room
This aint a mixtape
This is life!
Its been a long time get me accuainted with the world famous
You know how 0 point my aim is
Long range snipers, clash of the titans chrome python
In this 300 like lee knightis
Snob in the bulbllegoose, riding down the interstate
Where fiend put them needles in they arm and let them penetrate
Leaning sideways with my fitted straight
With 27's on point, the paintjob are new york minute made
Check my armor no clouds in my stones
Projects ringin standing by the cornerstore
Two glock on me, bang bang its the wanted war
That was so fly, now we bought anotha store
Screaming out thug life pouring belve on ya heart
Money I'm involved with it, wake up and ball with it
Kobe can song with it, uncut raw with it
Chop bricks take trips ot,
We before I had a goatee, I used to bag the OC
Yeah, fish scale nigga, what up ghost this
Stashin by the old tree, moving by coke leaf
Drama let the lama lick niggas like Charles Oaklee
Nigga dont assult me, I banana boat b r c k esses
And stuck em in a lexus
Im sitting fat like Preciouse, Christ up on the necklace
And I keep them clipse on a dresser
Yes sir, I'm bout bar, Louis bag and fuck em all
Bitches money and fast car, nigga I want it all
Yeah, word to my kids nigga, I want it all
Nascar game, why the fuck will I starr

Empty out the caNNON hit ya bitch you the truck and AR
With drop twohundred thousand and then fuck it off
King of the hell got em done bitch cut raw
She begged the last nigga, on as if she suckin soft
Black Superman, yeah I'm a butter law
I put this hollowtip on quarter inch you broken jaw

Blindfold your bitch toss her in the trunk
After the first 48 that bitch smelling like a skunk
Its a rap, I rap, when I rap the punk
Dont be any game mind you on tellin rap the bunks
The breakfast club nigga no capitain crunch,
This for my dog niggas that eat cats for lunch
Im hungry like I aint trapped in months
So nigga actin stunt my glock packed a punch
Or have em catch em when send the pinebox
Leave your head wrapped up months, while I passed the blunt
To my niggas, we all rocked out whats up jiggas
Sometimes I be in B K, with Fab on the freeway
Lincoln continental and I copped it off on ebay

Under my hood like its an olympic relay
My Flow Rida on time, no delay

Word to my red cross, I dont fuck with redcross

Old English in my system 'bout to kill me a nigga
See, I remember back in the days, loadin' my A.K.
Ridin' 'round in my Impala with my lungs full of haze
That's when I didn't give a fuck, now I got my sons
Shoot a nigga, he die, public enemy number one
But this ain't no action flick, no Johny Depp shit
When the TEC spit hollow tips in your Lexus
So, don't fuck with a Compton nigga
When he packin' a gat, yeah nigga, I stay strapped
Somethin' hot in here, nigga, it must be me
Somethin' hot in here, nigga, it must be me
Is it the shades? Is it the J's?
Is it the Bentley with the four colorways?
Or the old school sittin' on glaze?
What could it be?
It's 2 o'clock in the afternoon, I'm 'bout to roll a swisher
'Cause that's what real niggas do when they at home
Watchin' E.S.P.N. on a 70 inch flatscreen
K.G.'s away Jersey blowin' chronic that green
Gave up the hoop dreams, bubble with the crack dreams
Turn hood zombies into an Olympic track team
Till I got got shot and infiltrated the rap scene
Had to clear my life up, Doc. gave me the vaccine
Don't get it twisted, I still click clack things
Red beam attached to each and every strap
That I keep locked up in my basement
If I shoot a nigga will I be known
For gettin' Jason, I don't know
Still got a sick phase for shoot outs and car chases
Fuck Paccino 'cause we know niggas with scarred faces
And we go back like D-boys with small faces
And we crashin' them Ferraris like y'all hate me
Pharrell I think it's
Somethin' hot in here, nigga, it must be me
Somethin' hot in here, nigga, it must be me
Is it the shades? Is it the J's?
Is it the Bentley with the four colorways?
Or the old school sittin' on glaze, what could it be?
(You know they ass is full)
Niggas can't fuck with me, will stit
I guess I am a motha fuckin' legend, Will Smith
All I'm missin' is a bitch like Jaya, Bonnie and Clyde shit
Hit the fence like later, Syonara or we the dirt shit
Black rose phantom interior hurt shit
And I got some kisses from a couple Brooklyn bitches
Them hoes, they never testify, Beefs to Common
But Game keep it hood like Weez and top Rommy
Never stop comin' for the top
If it bakes a flesh wound if Feralla headshot
Motha fucka and when he take aim, bullets into your frame
My boss and allowed to when trigga swallow your vein
Can't walk through the club and take a piss
Without these new school rap niggas on my dick
Why you fuck around with you jewelry and all your wrist?

Somethin' hot in here, nigga, it must be me
Somethin' hot in here, nigga, it must be me

She don't wanna hit the J (she don't wanna hit it)
Now she don't wanna hit the J (woh oh woh oh)
All these bitches in my face, I'm blowing up
And when I'm stepping in the place, we be pouring up
Fourteen bottles of Ace, models showing up
I tell her homie break that down, and we gon' roll it up
It's Friday and she ain't got shit to do
And we ain't got shit to do
So umm, what's good with you?
Smoke a little, talk a little, roll that up
Girl twist that J, remind me of my nigga Rondo
She ain't trying to hit that J
Different J's, different lokes
Different days, different strokes
I smoke that shit that made Arnold and Willis broke
You know my lifestyle, swishers and them Lifestyles
Bitches in the white house, red Camaro piped out
I'll be iced out, my blunts be packed in
I'll smoke them till it's no more, I'm like the pack ten
I'm 'bout to pack ten bitches with them accents
Man we 'bout to pack twelve swishers in that black Benz

Two puffs, two verses. That's all you get Nigga!
And stop mean mugging motherfucker!
Verse 1
Uhuh, I need a gangster bitch
N*gga I ain't lyin, Im talkin when I fuck
She scream you need silence
No domestic violence (violence)
Just domestic diamonds
So lemme ice you out
So when you slidin down the pole
Doin your Magic City thing
Yo neck and wrist glow
Im dreamin, she ain't a stripper, she a classy girl
Goin off that Patron, she my nasty girl
First name, Rachael, last name Jones
You related to Nas, girls, Queens my second home
You know... we can tear it up
Weekend in Cannes, then we comin to America
...She love that Gucci, never been to ATL
But she love that Gucci
Brrr! She taught me how to cook cage
And I taught her how to cook crack
And I chopped it on her back
Now tell me where they do that
Verse 2
I put her on a Greyham
She know she better stay down
Ride and die like my Bentley
Man this bitch will never break down
She my bustin baby, you should see her bust a tre pound
Love Roc-A-Fella so much, she won't even call me Jay now
She roll my weedman, like she my wingman
Then we get high, play Tiger Woods on that weed damn
Love is for a season, haters 365
And the game Cats and Dogs, keep your bitch by your side
Got a hardtop Lambo, when the rain start to pour
Not the rain outside, talkin the rain indoors
Her girlfriend told her, that I was creepin with a stripper
Told her I was courtside, watchin the wack ass Clippers
Bitch please! Im a Laker fan and Kobe thats my n*gga
Keep my grass cut so I can see when the snake slith her
Shit, came out of no where like Khloe and Lamar
Kinda got a n*gga thinkin maybe Im.
Verse 3
I let her drive the Range on our first date
She the first one to put me on that Drake mixtape
"I just wanna be successful baby"
Take you out the Hudson jeans and redress you baby
We can walk down Rodaeo, turn around, you on Melrose
Fly to New York in the winter and try on some Timbos
Or we can hit South Beach, fuck with Ross and Timbo
The world is cherry pond, and we can slice it up like Kimbo
You cook the rock, I break it down
I wrap it up, you weigh them pounds
I make the car, you start the car
We can drive it out of town
Im your nigga right? And you my bitch (Yea.)
Even if they lock me up, she gon get them brakes there
And when we get tired, we hit the truck stop and sit there
And zip my 501's and she gon put her lips there
The memoirs of a perfect bitch
You gotta hold them down even if its.

Damn, damn, damn, damn
Heaven's prays, all I'm tryna do, praise him, praise I'm

Nigga I ain't pastor Mason yo
Nigga patting rhyme, peach Ciroc, Ace and y'all?
And since I got good taste and all
This for all the bad bitches couldn't wait to get they braces off
I know we in church, and the way that I'm thinking wrong
But inside the bible is the perfect way to sneak my phone
But I don't wanna do that, I came to take the service in
And stare at all the women who brought they Louis purses in
Bad bitches in here, forgive me for my sins
I ain't meant to walk inside the church cursing again
I wanna live righteous and you know I love Jesus
But you can't catch the holy ghost in the Prius
Halle motherfucking lujah
All my real niggas I salute ya
All the bad bitches, I'ma run throguh ya
Hop in my holy ghost, hallelujah
Damn, damn, damn, damn
Hop in my holy ghost, hallelujah
Damn, damn, damn, damn
Heaven's prays
Lookin' 'round the church like what that nigga doing here
He prolly told on somebody, posed to be doing years
But who am I to judge a nigga
AR don't wanna go to church, I can't budge the nigga
But I love the nigga, so I'ma go for both us
And put these G Star slacks with these Louie loafers
He rather sit outside and listen to Hova
But the service jumping, the pastor serving my mimosas
And all this ass in here, how do I focus
Collection plate bulging damn pastor you the coldest
My envelope stay swollen
So I'ma count my blessings now, somebody hold this
Halle motherfucking lujah
All my real niggas I salute ya
All the bad bitches, I'ma run through ya
Hop in my holy ghost, hallelujah
Damn, damn, damn, damn
Hop in my holy ghost, hallelujah
Damn, damn, damn, damn
Heaven's prays
Staring in the row behind me, man these fat hoes is too cheap
Ain't paying they tithes, taking up 2 seats
And look at God's house, pack full of sinners
With the sun ride service, now they back for the dinners
Yeah I know the chicken good but your soul ain't
And your outfit clean but your nose ain't
And I suppose ain't nobody a liar in here
If that was true, the whole church would be on fire in here
I'm so glad we have a choir in here
To wake me up every time I get tired in here
And one thing's for sure, gotta praise the Lord
'Cause when I went to Undefeated, they still had my fours
Fell to the floor like
Halle motherfucking lujah
All my real niggas I salute ya
All the bad bitches, I'ma run through ya
Hop in my holy ghost, hallelujah
Damn, damn, damn, damn
Hop in my holy ghost, hallelujah
Damn, damn, damn, damn
Heaven's prays
Tell 'em pray for me
It was God that brought Dre to me
Even brought the nigga Kanye for me
Bless but them niggas shot Big
Made a nigga feel ashamed of the the city where he live
Make a nigga hate the logo on the Dodger cap
Thinking back to that beamer, wish my nigga Pac was strapped
But I'm dreaming Las Vegas Boulevard, Afeni's son's bullet scars
Everybody king of Diamonds until the feds pull they cards
Not the deck though
Hip Hop was better off when it was just Dre, Scarface, and Esco
Memoirs of the gold chain
It's a cold game nigga, Johnny Coltrane
Black Versaces with the gold frame
Nigga said he sold 'caine that's a bold claim
14 had a brain that could throw flames
So strange, have to blow they mind, Cobain
Mama forgive me 'cause I'm tryna make a living, hah
Them niggas hatin' 'cause that Royce Phantom killing, hah
Niggas shining like they hanging from the ceiling, hah
Me and 'Ye killing (Something like my Jesus piece, hah)
Lord willin', I see a billion
'Til then, I let my nuts hang (Something like my Jesus piece)
Throw them suicide doors up
And let that Holy Ghost swang (Something like my Jesus piece)
That's the crack music, nigga
Never spit a verse 'cause I was making trap music, nigga
I'm not an army, I'm a movement
The flow is water, Andre tried to Ice Cube him
Ice Cubin', roof translucent
Chick on my side tryna get my Trues loose
When I'm talkin' 'bout God, she 'posed to bow her head
Now she all on the blog, steady postin' 'bout her head
Got me thinking like a father, is the world safe?
Got me clinging to my daughter like shark fins in water
Rocks in my ears something Titanic
This is my life and it's exactly how I planned it, damn it
God says everything happens for a reason
I seen four seasons at The Four Seasons
Take that chinchilla off, poor kids is freezing
Cookin' up in the same pot they ain't got to pee in
Mama forgive me 'cause I'm tryna make a living, hah
Them niggas hatin' 'cause that Royce Phantom killing, hah
Niggas shining like they hanging from the ceiling, hah
Me and 'Ye killing (Something like my Jesus piece, hah)
Lord willin', I see a billion
'Til then, I let my nuts hang (Something like my Jesus piece)
Throw them suicide doors up
And let that Holy Ghost swang (Something like my Jesus piece)
Pieces on gold leashes
Cruisers, around greases make them cohesive
I'm the sun shining with God features
Draw closer to a true blood bleeder, soul of a southern preacher
Went from dinner with bottom feeders to world leaders
We throw the peace up, knowing the world need us
Eagerness to live life and see the bright lights
To sacrifices we made it's sorta Christ-like
At the after party thinking what the afterlife's like
He paid for my sins, is it really priced right?
Fuck it, I see the light, raw Stacy delight
Can't deny my Jesus piece that's so Peter-like
Chicks crow for dough, get low for mo'
A combo she end up at the condo
Another Jane Doe or a golden angel
Pendant on an angle, watch the chain glow
Mama forgive me 'cause I'm tryna make a living, hah
Them niggas hatin' 'cause that Royce Phantom killing, hah
Niggas shining like they hanging from the ceiling, hah
Me and 'Ye killing (Something like my Jesus piece, hah)
Lord willin', I see a billion
'Til then, I let my nuts hang (Something like my Jesus piece)
Throw them suicide doors up
And let that Holy Ghost swang (Something like my Jesus piece)
[Hook:]
My Phantom so mean like I washed that motherfucker every Sunday in holy water
My Jesus piece clean, even my shoes are Christians, I'm walking on holy water
She came out them True Religion jeans and fell straight to her knees like she was dipped in holy water
Holy water, holy water
[Verse 1:]
Back when Michael Jordan was raw
'92 was the year my city was city of God
Coke on the boulevard, crack fiends skiing the slaloms
Is exactly how drug lords found their way from the bottom
Them Yeezy's drop got 'em, couldn't afford 'em you shot 'em
Cause they the same price as fucking red bottoms
We don't pop tags, leave that motherfucker on it
Return it back to the store when you no longer want it
Sleep outside for days for a pair of J's
The you sleep outside forever cause you got sprayed
If you gon' die for em, they better be some number 4s
Or some shit made in Japan you can never find in the stores
Rolex watches, Gucci belts, and Louis luggage
Definitely set us apart from niggas when we in public
Jeffery Campbell and Michael Kors got you looking rugged
Gave her a Louis bag, now she love me
Take a look at her posin' on my car cause
[Hook:]
My Phantom so mean like I washed that motherfucker every Sunday in holy water
My Jesus piece clean, even my shoes are Christians, I'm walking on holy water
She came out them True Religion jeans and fell straight to her knees like she was dipped in holy water
Holy water, holy water
[Verse 2:]
Met a girl named Christian in some Christian, she a Christian
Suck a dick like sucking dick is her life's mission
Trynna' save her ass like trynna' save a stripper
She fine as fuck, you trynna' fuck, that's the reason you tip her
And all I'm sayin' is a watch and a gold chain
Can't make Bobby Valentino, Johnny Coltrane
And she knows this, that's why her mouth wide
Openin' up her legs straight up like they suicide
I cross my heart and hope to die
If something happens to my voice and can no longer provide
Should I run and hide? No. hustle and survive
Workin' 9 to 5 until sweat drips into my eyes
And if it burns like the kush, then I go back to sellin' pies
Switchin' lanes in that Cutlass, rubbin' her thighs while I drive
Reminiscin' on the days I was rollin' broke
Jesus piece on the rearview, holy ghost
Amen!
[Hook:]
My Phantom so mean like I washed that motherfucker every Sunday in holy water
My Jesus piece clean, even my shoes are Christians, I'm walking on holy water
She came out them True Religion jeans and fell straight to her knees like she was dipped in holy water
Holy water, holy water
You know I love you like cooked food, I'm a good dude
Let's hit the Roscoe's on Pico, I'm in a hood mood
I'm sittin' here thinkin' 'bout all the things I could do
So what you should do is
Play your position for Berkin bags, we poppin' tags
Her shoe game sick, we drinkin' Ace out of Red Bottles
True gang shit, fuck with me and you're famous
Kanye'd my bitch, now she's away from the nameless
Camera flashes from strangers, turn a Range to a manger
Jesus piece on the plate, yea my baby an angel
Fell straight up out of Heaven into what we into
Who knew we'd grew into, whatever we into
That's too much for your mental so we snapback that
Game on point like the stripes on my Gucc' backpack
My ladybug, yea she cool like that
In them Trues, why you move like that
You know my lady always on
She know I need it so
She know she can get
All that, all that, all that, all that, all that
My lady got me going
I'm where she already knows
She knows she can get
All that, all that, all that
Uh, you my lady
And that pussy feel like a haven
We can make babies, let's be creative
She say leave them tricks alone but I'm a skater
I love her like her daddy, told her no man would
I got a lot of bad bitches, she the only one good
I got her flowers for nothing, she smiling and blushing
If I don't answer my phone, then we probably fucking, ya
She love my tattoos
Ain't got no room for her name but I'mma make room
She let her hair down, we have a stare down
She said "I'm glad you ate it, where my cap & gown?"
Told her "I can be your chauffeur," dick like a limo
Multiple orgasms, that's my M.O
Red bone pretty
I kiss her from her titty to her clitty
You know my lady always on
She know I need it so
She know she can get
All that, all that, all that, all that, all that
My lady got me going
I'm where she already knows
She knows she can get
All that, all that, all that
Look, my girl's sweet like my hotel floor
From where they ran through more keys than a hotel door
Indeed, give her the D now the whole hotel know
Feel like I'm looking down from Heaven screaming "Oh, Hell no!"
When you hop on top, girl, that's what it feel like
She always had a player back like them field lights
And every time I left it ain't feel right
Cheated on her and she stayed, that's just real life
Cause it's hard when you ain't on the same coast
Burning bread in the club so all these girls want toast
Hoes try and wave but we ain't on the same boat
They trying to sink everything that we made float
She told me 'bout her ex man, her old boy stories
And how she had a dildo, you know, toy stories
Don't fuck her on her period, ain't into horror stories
I take her to my favourite restaurant she order for me, cause she know me
You know my lady always on
She know I need it so
She know she can get
All that, all that, all that, all that, all that
My lady got me going
I'm where she already knows
She knows she can get
All that, all that, all that
I'm feeling your style
I'm loving your swag
I like how your jeans fit
You're killing that bag
You working them heels
Your diamonds are real
You give me the chills, girl
You all that
Niggas called me to set you up
Want me to come and wet you up
'Cause you a out of town
Nigga like Biggie heard about the shit with Diddy
So I came through to vest you up
And I got a vest for 40, a vest for Hush
A vest for every nigga with an owl on his chest and what
I got LA unified, you're better off committing suicide
Teachers ain't testin' us
See I know how it feel to be platinum plus
Niggas is jealous of you so they try to wrap you up
Tat you up, but it's OVO blood money
Nigga catch these bullets like he catch the bus
Dark fame is a mothafucka
Do a nigga four favors, when you can't do the fifth
How soon they forget?
Run up on you at your granny's house
Leave you lyin' like Fif'
How a nigga supposed to love you niggas?
Heart beatin' fast when I dap and when I hug you niggas
Dre told me not to trust you niggas
Your energy off, you're finicky, I rush you niggas
Just walk around the crib like
Why a nigga can't live? Get this money, fuck these bitches though
Thinkin' 'bout the beef like
We can pass these motherfuckin' straps like a physical
This my city, nigga everybody know it
Ridin' 'round town, just me and my four pound
Tucked in my Tom Fords, hopin' I ain't gotta show it
LA niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit
40 I'm fucked up
Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizing there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever asked is keep it 8 more than 92 with me, 100, yeah, 100
All I ever asked is 100, yeah, 100
All I ever asked is 100
Thank me later, thanks for nothin'
Thanks for bluffin'
Thank you so, so much for wearing your true colors to every single fuckin' function
Had niggas tell me to my face how we were family
And how they love me, while they was skimmin' off the budget
Now, when I see 'em, they the ones that's actin' funny
People been reachin' out to me
And I'm on some straight unresponsive shit
I would have so many friends
If I didn't have money, respect and accomplishments
I would have so many friends
If I held back the truth and I just gave out compliments
I would have all of your fans if I didn't go pop
And I stayed on some conscious shit
I would have so many more friends
If I lost my success and my confidence
I'm in the club every time that they play the competition
If they even play the competition and I seen the response they get
Nobody's even hearin' it, on top of the pyramid
Might go to Jamaica, disappear again
My circle got so small that it's a period, sayin' to myself
Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizing there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever asked is keep it 8 more than 92 with me, 100, yeah, 100
All I ever asked is 100, yeah, 100
All I ever asked is 100
Miss 4 Cent, that was my real nigga
Held a nigga down since he was a lil' nigga
If he was still alive, he would kill niggas
He was Lil Snupe, I was Meek Mill, nigga
Know how it feel when you're missin' your nigga though
Can't think so you roll up that indigo
Stressin' while drivin' down Figueroa
Blowin' kush clouds until his ghost is in my Ghost, damn
Make a real nigga wanna give his life to God like, "Here it go"
Screamin' Frog's name at the clouds, they don't hear me though
Guess they too busy with 2Pac and Biggie though
You niggas don't feel me though
That was on Suge's watch, I'll take Suge's watch
You dissin' Drizzy, that's cool but don't come to my city though
Not even to H-Town
So underground that I gotta be a trill nigga
Strapped up from the waist down
That's word to Pimp C, J Prince is my real nigga
Shit was so simple when Henchman was out
He had a young nigga right there with Meech
So happy when Bleu Davinci got out
We came up on these California streets
LA niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit
Got a nigga confused, but why a nigga gotta choose?
Don't even matter dawg 'cause I'ma always be a real nigga
Always be a real nigga
I never learned how to be nothin' but a real nigga
Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizing there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever asked is keep it 8 more than 92 with me, 100, yeah, 100
All I ever asked is 100, yeah, 100
All I ever asked is 100

Game Ft. Fat Joe & Young Chris - GreyStone
Yo, it's the nigga with the nasty flow and the clean rag six-four
With the D's spinnin' I can bag a hoe
Top down, so my rag can show, whatever in the dutch
Purple or orange, haze, it's just a bag of 'dro
Hit snatch with my khakis on, Aladdin Lounge
In Mark Jacobs denim and Don Magli's on
I'm a gangsta and the birds they love it
20 with a babyface and sit on base like Kirby Puckett
You can't buy a Ferrari, fuck it, cop lle' from J
The bricks come with Louis Vuitton luggage

The quarters is 75, the ball is live
Ain't nobody fumblin' on my block

Nothin' less than a hundred a pop, anything less you a cop
Shoot you and take your vest and your glock, motherfuckers

Puffin' on sticky green, you got to come fuck wit me
My team is just oh, so clean, you got to come fuck wit me
What'chu know about stackin' G's, you got to come fuck wit me
I'm in the streets like the place is mine, told to cover my tracks
I push paper to increase my shine
I'm on my chief, jumpin' out the wagon like Tyco
And get the kind of paper that these niggaz'll die fo'
Bossed out, camouflage under my vest B
Motorbike, fast cars, broads and jetskis
Rule number 1, keep your eye on your cash flow
'Cause rule number 2, will get rid of your best so
None of 'em best show, ridin' in stress mode
'Less they got petrol, pushin' that Benz slow
Pick up the Game, let's count some cash
Then we, get to the do', then you put on your mask
On some other shit, ridin' wit'cha boy now
We on the West coast, seek and destroy now

We had a riot in the streets, fin' to blow now fo'sho' now
What'chu know about stackin' G's, you got to come fuck wit me
Puffin' on sticky green, you got to come fuck wit me

What'chu know about stackin' G's, you got to come fuck wit me

Buildin' my stocks off the blocks and the wears will sag
Not Gil but tryin' to top, the nerd Bill Gates
From the city of project buildings and them Mossberg K's
San Francisco, West coast, Northern Bay, California
Man, it's Get Low so best to toast or torch'll spray on ya
Uhh, makin' mafia moves, skate from the cops

But nah, the ball, it don't stop
A shot callin', if I fall then my thoughts gon' flock
Yeah, underboss with Game and Doc Figgaro

Holdin' weight in the dope state
Tokin' the 8-8, oh, fold [Incomprehensible]
Watch our bread and our team skyrocket

What'chu know about stackin' G's, you got to come fuck wit me
Puffin' on sticky green, you got to come fuck wit me
My team is just oh, so clean, you got to come fuck wit me
What'chu know about stackin' G's, you got to come fuck wit me

Bitches, I'm gettin money, bottles and rocking chains

Suicidal thoughts, highway to heaven riding like a boss
Condominium in the clouds, 60g's a month
50 floors, marble walls, pictures of Boston Georgia
Bitches snortin' blow, f-ckin fast and cookin' dope
Sanctify, Bally shoes, Audemars, Franck Muller [?]

I put straight shots in they hair
Make pretty girls, do the ugly face
And they just my song on
Move back I need dougie space like ay, ay
Then it's right back to my muggin' face
Niggas said put the weed out
BBM, you buggin face
We walked in, want somethin', bottles pop like we won some'n
Raise a glass for err'ybody that's done something from nothin'
No grind, no shine, dress code, we pay no mind
Cargo's and J's on, they let sun in, no blinds
All I drink is my shit
Stop playin, Youtube
But tonight we on that Red Berry and Cranberry, Soo Woo
[Lil Wayne]
And I'm smokin' on that purp
Sippin' on that purp
I came in this bitch with some niggas that will murk
And we aint bout all that talkin', you a dead man walking
Stomp a nigga ass out, in these number 4 Jordans
Got a scope on the barrell that's a hammer with a camera
Hollow tips nigga, tip a nigga like a dancer

Its been a long damn time since a nigga sold dope
But if you put a brick right in front of me, I remember
Bakin soda and a triple beam, I remember
Blow the fully auto magazine
, I remember
I done fucked so many bitches that I cant remember names
But if you put that pussy right up in my face, I remember
Drop that pussy down on the floor, I remember
The way she comin' down on the pole, I remember
Pop the pussy, dont play with it
I dont care if Kanye hit it, I dont care if Jay hit it
Imma eat it up and Imma lay with it
We shot a chopper at the gun range
Got stupid cars, got dumb change
Red bottoms, let the tongue hang
Got an off-white Porsche, cum stain
Im whippin work (I remember)
Roll up that purp (I remember)
Pour up that syrup
(I dont remember)
(How Tunechi had that purple Slushy comin out that blender)
Got a Keisha, got a Rhonda
Got a Nisha, got a Tanya
Met a Tishaun, met a Honda
And I eat her anaconda
Got condoms in that condo
Got kush greener than Rondo
Still hit me up for that blow
Drop top Rari shit
I drove it like I stole it
The Lambo in the shop, told my bitch to Range Rove
Microwave broke, so a nigga had to stove it
Dropped it off to my Auntie, told her hold it
Im posted right now
posted in this Gucci link
7 dead, 30 mill, wonder what Kool G think
Quotes not hassles (I remember)
Now its the middle of June, and its snowing like December
If it get into the sacs in your hood, I could mend ya
Ya nigga talkin reckless on your song
Ill revenge ya
Pull up to the club in a Phantom, I had a vision
Break em all down on my Hummer, end of vision
Pop that pussy up in that hydraulics (whats that)
6 4
throw that brick inside a pot and cook it, whip it good though
Baking soda inside of her bowl, hey yo, watch me blow
Promethazine mixed with a Sprite, poor it foo
Been sippin syrup all night, and I get higher than a plane
Yeah I remember your pussy girl, but I dont know your name
I got diamonds hanging off, they can talk of the insane
Ever since I gave her that molly, man that girl aint been the same
Better pop pussy for a real nigga
Thats on the way, Imma deal with ya
Im a real boss, that real sauce
Dont try me bitch, I will floss
Thats real talk, my top off, Im throw it off
Homo that green? plate go (chronic)
I hustle take no days off
(FUTURE)
Holdin' my daughter in the booth
Her momma out there somewhere in that Bentley tryin' to find a roof
Poof, I wave my wand and here comes Kendrick
Niggas say the west ain't winnin', I'm just tryin' to find the proof
Speakin' of Proof, I'm 'bout to roll one with Snoop
Blow the smoke out to your memory and toast to Eminem
Cause he, gave me the shit that I needed on Documentary
Keep it real with myself, I got murdered like John Kennedy
But that was cool cause I was just there for the energy
Watchin' Bizarre pop pills while 2Pac in my Hennessy
First time in Detroit, had to rock the Grant Hills
Cause I threw up my dukes when California was at a stand still
But hope ain't lost cause Dr. Dre the man still
Had faith in me, knew I had heat like an anvil
Ran through entire crews, put their remains in a landfill
And I ain't lost the hunger, I'm eatin' out the can still
Yeah, wherever Hov and Nas at in the world right now
I know they listenin' like
This young nigga be killin' this shit
Hip-hop is life's ciroc I'm 'bout to drop a pill in this shit
Let's go, esco bars nigga, like Nas nigga
The flow is Rakim with the Birdman cars nigga
Hold on I gotta take Birdman's call nigga
Stunna, what up blood?
"Whattup blood? What's poppin' my nigga?
Look, I know this the last one after this it's straight Cash Money, my nigga
So, it's YMCMB, wild life my nigga, let's get it poppin'"
Rich game
Off the chain, one hunnid
Suwoo
New coupe, remove roof
I'm from where niggas'll do your bitch and bitch niggas'll do you
Inevitably we take celebrity bitches and run a chu-chu
We puttin' on magnums, taggin' that wagon, some of these birds kookoo
And murder is what I do to
These Just Blazes, Kanyes, shit on Swizz, I handle my biz
The whole world know what I do to Dre's shit
Niggas know I'm classic, I ain't even gotta say shit
Frank Ocean more of a man than you niggas, get up off that gay shit
Fuck copyin' styles, niggas be tracin'
Whether it's me, the movie, or Jadakiss, niggas just can't fuck with Jayceon
So let's go
Laa, da da da dup da ah
Thought you love me before
I'm glad to kill it some more
Every hood needs an anthem
Laa, da da da dup da ah
Winning comes with a price
No matter how hard you try
Can't buy freedom
We're far from being free
Yea we're far from being free
We're far from free
Wanna welcome everybody to Jesus Piece
After my album fades, my competition will lyrically be deceased
Niggas saying I'm underrated
Like a younger Jay with heat, but not the ones the Thunder play with
So Los Angeles King is sort of an understatement
Let me find a gun to play with, I leave you niggas under pavement
Tell 'em they rent's due, pay up or get cement shoes
All this dope be around, you act like I ain't lean on that fence too
But now you up here and bitches and cars is what I'm into
You wanna send me to God, I wear 45 in that French shoe
I fuck with Wale, Ross, and my nigga French too
And me and Face just slashed the last beat up like a Ginsu
My album like a 'Rari, a lot of dope features
Glad you bought it, now sit back and just blow reefer
I know the concept behind it is gon' reach ya
Now turn this mufucka up and blow speakers
Ladies and gentleman
I would like to introduce to you
An incredible gentleman
He goes by the name Elijah Blake
Let's go
Laa, da da da dup da ah
Thought you love me before
I'm glad to kill it some more
Every hood needs an anthem
Laa, da da da dup da ah
Winning comes with a price
No matter how hard you try
Can't buy freedom
We're far from being free
Yea we're far from being free
We're far from free
And last but definitely not least
I wanna send a special shout out, to my nigga James Harden
Another Los Angele's nigga carrying rockets
Ballin' on you bitches
A fuck nigga, thats that shit I dont like
They throwin bottles, Im throwin models
Just cause I give a bitch long pipe
Doing shows on the soccer field, thats dome right?
I be singin, he be singin, so its on fight
But hold up, I aint give a nigga no green light
This head up, my bread up, one-on-one, what you scared, bruh?
Matter fact, take care bruh, you a pussy nigga
My nigga Tunechi, yeah that nigga nice
Shout out to Nicki, man that ass tight
Them eyebrows, man, them shits is yikes
OVO, you overdosed, screamin YOLO no, I live twice.
You know I love you like cooked food, I'm a good dude
Let's hit the Roscoe's on Pico, I'm in a hood mood
I'm sittin' here thinkin' 'bout all the things I could do
So what you should do is
Play your position for Berkin bags, we poppin' tags
Her shoe game sick, we drinkin' Ace out of Red Bottles
True gang shit, fuck with me and you're famous
Kanye'd my bitch, now she's away from the nameless
Camera flashes from strangers, turn a Range to a manger
Jesus piece on the plate, yea my baby an angel
Fell straight up out of Heaven into what we into
Who knew we'd grew into, whatever we into
That's too much for your mental so we snapback that
Game on point like the stripes on my Gucc' backpack
My ladybug, yea she cool like that
In them Trues, why you move like that
You know my lady always on
She know I need it so
She know she can get
All that, all that, all that, all that, all that
My lady got me going
I'm where she already knows
She knows she can get
All that, all that, all that
Uh, you my lady
And that pussy feel like a haven
We can make babies, let's be creative
She say leave them tricks alone but I'm a skater
I love her like her daddy, told her no man would
I got a lot of bad bitches, she the only one good
I got her flowers for nothing, she smiling and blushing
If I don't answer my phone, then we probably fucking, ya
She love my tattoos
Ain't got no room for her name but I'mma make room
She let her hair down, we have a stare down
She said "I'm glad you ate it, where my cap & gown?"
Told her "I can be your chauffeur," dick like a limo
Multiple orgasms, that's my M.O
Red bone pretty
I kiss her from her titty to her clitty
You know my lady always on
She know I need it so
She know she can get
All that, all that, all that, all that, all that
My lady got me going
I'm where she already knows
She knows she can get
All that, all that, all that
Look, my girl's sweet like my hotel floor
From where they ran through more keys than a hotel door
Indeed, give her the D now the whole hotel know
Feel like I'm looking down from Heaven screaming "Oh, Hell no!"
When you hop on top, girl, that's what it feel like
She always had a player back like them field lights
And every time I left it ain't feel right
Cheated on her and she stayed, that's just real life
Cause it's hard when you ain't on the same coast
Burning bread in the club so all these girls want toast
Hoes try and wave but we ain't on the same boat
They trying to sink everything that we made float
She told me 'bout her ex man, her old boy stories
And how she had a dildo, you know, toy stories
Don't fuck her on her period, ain't into horror stories
I take her to my favourite restaurant she order for me, cause she know me
You know my lady always on
She know I need it so
She know she can get
All that, all that, all that, all that, all that
My lady got me going
I'm where she already knows
She knows she can get
All that, all that, all that
I'm feeling your style
I'm loving your swag
I like how your jeans fit
You're killing that bag
You working them heels
Your diamonds are real
You give me the chills, girl
You all that
When you hear that sound, you already know what time it is
I Only Drop classics and we back again with another one
The duo you love to hate, live from Los Angeles The Game, I am DJ SKEE
I just want y'all to understand what I'm about to do
Keep it gangsta in this Luis Vuitton designer suit
In front of club Liv stunnin' in that Masi coupe
Then we're gonna check China see what King of Diamonds do
Pass the kush to A.R. when I recline the roof
That nigga get down for me like I'm about to shoot
Tell em' its Money Gang my nigga Sonic real, and Kid Red be running trains like a monorail
Introduce you to my team niggas you need to know, we popping spades the bottles look like CP3O
Blowing that loud security telling us to keep it low
But when you pay me for a walk through this is what you need to know
We smoking all night Kev got a handle for me and tell the owner that 12 bottles is mandatory
And we gon' need a few Cirocs and them Gooses too
Same go for Green house and Dream down in Huston too
Watching Malaya eating shrimp while I throw these ones
Jazz drunk as fuck cause every time I look he show his gun
Every time we at the strip club he got the coldest one
Surrounded by killas cause J-Prince knows his son

Riding through the jungles in that mothafuckin'' elephant

Spent half a mill on a Ferrari, I coulda leased it
Driving Scott Storch's Bugatti 'fore they released it
Drop The Documentary, rockin' khakis with creases
Dope and hip hop, it resurfaced with some leeches
Ten times platinum, now I'm chillin' where the beach is
Time to show the world what a motherfuckin' beast is
Blanca, bullet proof cars in Sri Lanka
12 years old, on his shoulder, a rocket launcher
10 thousand miles away, there's an owner of a corner store
A white man walks in, spit shinin' his Audemar
While somewhere in Africa, Jo-Burg and Congo is goin' to war
Rebels enslavin' they own people, diggin' water or
Get murdered 'cause that choppa is a carnivore
He found one and stole it, now the village tryna find that boy
Blood Diamonds

How you sellin' the shit our people is diggin' for
Diamonds, cotton, that belong to niggas though
LeBron and Durantula gave America a look at gold
And what you give us back, is another fucking liquor store
And we need blunts, so we walk in that motherfucker
Money in the safe, so we in that motherfucker
But you can't forget the tape, tryna pin a motherfucker
DEA ain't got a case, I'mma win that motherfucker
And it ain't about the Chinese, dude, I eat Chinese food
Where you think Michael Jordan find these shoes
We robbin' each other for 'em, think I should hide these jewels
Run up on you in broad day with them Siamese 2's
But nah, Mandela did 28 straight
Without a fucking complaint, put a afro on a saint
Put a wig on a judge, put a nigga in some chains
Over change, kill him, lethal injection inside his veins
Blood Diamonds
Look at Blood Diamonds
Blood Diamonds
Now take a look at Blood Diamonds
Brutus killed Caesar
And Judas killed Jesus
John Wilkes Boothe killed Lincoln
And you thought he freed slaves, what the fuck was you thinkin'
Nigga fuck Lincoln
I'm rolling up kush in my Lincoln, now let it sink in
Rolled against Obama now you divin' in the deep end
I'd rather take my chances at this water fountain drinkin'
Where the fuck is the loyalty, knock these niggas fuckin' teeth in
In the hood singin' like they Aubrey or The Weeknd
Pull that towel from under that door, and let it seep in
There's a lot of shit I Don't Like, so bring Chief Keef in
I don't like these phony ass jewellers with that fake shit
Overcharging niggas an arm and leg just to make shit
And you wonder why we take shit, y'all put us on slave ships
That's the reason we hate shit, rob my own niggas for them
Blood Diamonds
Look at Blood Diamonds

Now take a look at Blood Diamonds

Nigga that sold grams nominated for a Grammy

Me and my apostles play the corner like Revis
Now I'm on Noah's ark floating through Saint Regis
You know how Jesus do
Pull up on you in that Maybach coupe, hop out, tape pursuit
Lamborghini merci beaucoup, mwah!
Couldn't do it without Jesus
Got a passport fuck I need with a visa?
Got a black card fuck I need with a Visa?
I dont fuck with 'Bron but got on them south beaches
[Hook: Dre]
[Verse 2: Game]
Pull up, holy ghost, they have seizures
Hop out, gun smoke, the gat sneezes
Niggas see me in real life say "oh Jesus!"
Might just save your life and not squeeze it
Heathen ain't supposed to be breathing
The hood crucify me came back as black Jesus
Audemar shitting on niggas, that's feces
Brown Mase tangerine guts, that's Reese's
Tune on the album ain't have to pay for the feature
That's the way it go down when it's YMCMB shit
Stunna my nigga came into the game and Master P shit
Bought a red Ferrari for the young black Jesus
Give me Stevie's eyes black Jesus
So I can see why they killing in the Chi black Jesus
How did Chris Lighty really die black Jesus?
Don't answer that
He's probably in heaven where B.I.G. is
Chorus
For not being who you claim

The dumb mistake tryin to jumpin with blake
These niggas in my lane
Lob city in these streets
Jessus piece on my chain

I went through hell to get to where heaven is
Lucy in that red dress lookin devilish
Scale a 1 to 10 she lookin elevenish
If she aint ridin shotty AK 47 is
Shorty came to me when she left her man
I looked at her and said you sumthin else
But the best way to get over sumbody
Is gettin under sumone else
On that note im in that 1,2,3 pin that
Baby tellin me im the best I b yellin i been that

Niggas fan of my instagram

Tryin to hack my email
Niggas wisperin to themselves
All huddled up like females
Your bitch about to be detailed

She choked up like Sprewell

Ridin around wit that Houston rocket
Keep all that of that Jeremy lin shit in yo pocket
Chorus 2x
Slim Thug

Couple pounds of that kush I aint the only one getting wasted
Smoke a lil, sell the rest ima hustla baby

Strapped up got extra armor

Chorus
Game Ft. Pharrell - It Must Be Tough
Game Ft. Pharrell - It Must Be Tough
Open the pearly gates, bright white lights Madonna
Angels lined up in my honor, ya' honor
Name me king
Name me king
I took the crown, infiltrated their fortress
Kidnap the queen, rode away on white horses
Name me king
Name me king
Brick by brick I built my fortress
My queen beautiful, Lamborghini is gorgeous
Phantom in the courtyard, 400 horses
Growl made the towers fall, 911 Porsches
Number 9 Jordan's pause the Air Forces
Kush clouds, blunts lit by Olympic torches
Gold bars melted and what returned Rolexes
Niggas got Breitlings to burn
Loyalty to earn
Royalty to who it may concern this is Los Angeles King Snapback
Sipping 'tron out the Stanley cup, I don't give a fuck
Drown them in the moat and let the bridge up
My son, my heir in Nike Airs, named my little nigga King
Meaning you should bow at his feet before God intervene
Even when I was in front of triple beams
Stack paper to the ceiling, to the fiends I was king
Open the pearly gates, bright white lights Madonna
Angels lined up in my honor, ya' honor
Name me king
Name me king
I took the crown, infiltrated their fortress
Kidnap the queen, rode away on white horses
Name me king
Name me king
Raise your glass for the last of the kingpins
The crown in the Maserati grill is mingling
Rollies cross oceans like Frank out in England
The Gay Pride bezel rainbow like it's spring again
Haah crack rock, crack rock nigga
My SC430 was a drop nigga
Go figure, this nigga play Go Fish
My only pet was fish scale not a goldfish
My young baby sitter now my old bitch
Blowjobs cause what I sold made her nose itch
(Yughck!) it's the king being crowned
Watch my predecessor fall like the sun going down (God!)
It's sunset, this is Sun Tzu (War!)
He paved the way I brought a ton through (Whooo!)
Been on his heels like a gum shoe
He took the throne so I could run through (Yughck!)
Open the pearly gates, bright white lights Madonna
Angels lined up in my honor, ya' honor
Name me king
Name me king
I took the crown, infiltrated their fortress
Kidnap the queen, rode away on white horses
Name me king
Name me king
Rose petals at my feet when I'm stepping out the Rolls
The royal penis is clean, Versace belt gold
Sweatin' like a slave where them pies get sold
Accompanied by fourteen karats stold
Adjust the temperature let the heat rise up
Like Jesus Shuttlesworth in that glass jar
Blue flame glowing like a Avatar
Five more minutes says the solid gold hand going 'round on my Audemar
Angels in the wing, ass naked do your thing
Show me what that baking soda bring, do it for your king
Every time I look up, they cook up
I be the master of them P's I got the hook up
From New Orleans to Virginia
I told her stuff them pies in her Virginia
Never been caught, can't be bought, she's a winner
Fly 'em south for the winter make it back home for dinner
Open the pearly gates, bright white lights Madonna
Angels lined up in my honor, ya' honor
Name me king
Name me king
I took the crown, infiltrated their fortress
Kidnap the queen, rode away on white horses
Name me king
Name me king
The Game ft. Kanye West, Pusha T, Chief Keef, Jadakiss & Big Sean - I Don't Like
We gonna let this motherfucker breathe for a minute
It's still aftermath, it's still aftermath
Now when I said we gonna let this motherfucker breathe
I meant this motherfucking beat is dead
Were gonna preform CPR to bring that motherfucker back to life
Now let that motherfucker breathe
Compton's my city, that motherfucker ain't never pretty
Gave Pac life then motherfuckers that killed Biggie
Then motherfuckers that killed Biggie
Then motherfuckers that killed Biggie
Notoriouses, bring that Benz in
I'm about a dollar, nigga fuck 50 Cent
I heard Tony Yayo can't pay the rent
I heard Lloyd Banks can't pay the rent
I beat the G-Unit out of 40 Glocc
Sue me for forty grand, that same forty will get you shot
IPhone in my hand doing the forty whop
That nigga looked up and thought he saw 40 Pacs
Looking out of my window I see forty cops
Trying to serve me that subpoena, I'm on this Xbox
2 Chainz voice, smoking that Wiz Khalifa
Pass to Waka Flocka, let me spit this ether
Yeah let me spit this ether
Yeah yeah yeah, 'til it blow the speaker
From eating Reese's Pieces to pulling guns out
For that Little Caesar's Pizza
All the way to jacking niggas for their Jesus pieces
I'm God to you bitch ass niggas put that on Matthew, Paul and Peter
Compton's my city, that motherfucker ain't never pretty
Gave Pac life then motherfuckers that killed Biggie
Then motherfuckers that killed Biggie
Then motherfuckers that killed Biggie
Fuck with me, fuck with me
Fuck with me, nigga you stuck with me
Forever and ever and ever
Shyne Po ain't rich, Shyne po'
All the way in Belize with Kendrick's dick in his throat
Good kid, mad city, mad kid, bad city
Nothing from Compton could ever be trash
You hear that nigga voice sound like a dick in his ass
He reminiscing, a Compton nigga's bitch in prison
Used to be Christian, now that nigga Jew
Can't step foot in America so what he gon' do
P.Diddy's stuntman, Jackie Chan your ass through
Hood pass revoked, get your fucking brains blew
Blood on that yarmulke, now you really Piru
Soon as they killed Biggie that man became you
But you couldn't become him cause you were shooting at the roof
Compton's my city, that motherfucker ain't never pretty
Gave Pac life then motherfuckers that killed Biggie
Then motherfuckers that killed Biggie
Then motherfuckers that killed Biggie
I always wondered why Puff wasn't in that truck
I said I always wondered why Puff wasn't in that truck
Let that shit breathe, let that shit breathe
This my motherfucking city
Five motherfucking albums
The Documentary, classic
Doctor's Advocate, classic
Everything in between and Jesus piece, classic
I bumped Ether, bumped Takeover
Seein' Jay and Nas on stage was hip-hop's makeover
And that very day you knew niggas was born
Tyler the Creators, Drake, J Coles, and Big Seans
Time for the world to pay homage
Bow to the rap Gods or them K's vomit
Fuck you know about Dipset you little dipshit
If you ain't fuck, then you ain't get your dick wet
I see your little chain
I see your little dreads, tryin' to be a Lil Wayne, shit
I used to wanna be a little Hov
Started with a little rock, got me a little stove
Made a little money, bought me a little Rov'
Paid cash money like I was from Hollygrove
Sold ten mill, everybody know my name now
thinkin' back, it's a motherfuckin' shame how
Biggie got killed and Pac got murked
Sometimes I gotta step in the church, 'cause I ain't tryin' to go to hell
As the blood spills from my pen
It's time to confess my sins, 'cause I ain't tryin' to go to hell
I smoke weed, pop pills, but I'm thinkin' it's time for me to chill
'Cause I ain't tryin' to go to hell
I'm tryin' to get some head tonight, have a stripper in my bed tonight
But I ain't tryin' to go to hell
Father forgive me, 'cause I ain't perfect
No, no no no
Why is everything wrong?
Oh I can't get it right, I always try to get it right
Dre promised me records, I never got 'em
That's why I had nightmares that a nigga shot him
For all my albums missed records
Felt he shitted on me for Kendrick, recorded diss records
And Kendrick, my nigga, put him on his first mixtape
I pop champagne when I heard he was with Dre
And I'm tellin' y'all this true story 'cause I'm real
Dre, first time, hearing 'bout it, wonder how he feel
'Cause I feel like shit severin' the relationship
The only doctor I knew to make all of his patients rich
Snoop, Pac, 'em, 50
Me, K Dot, watch us do a 360
Plus The Documentary saved me from penitentiaries
I ain't trippin', niggas been disloyal for centuries
Finally got the crown, this motherfucker meant for me
Funny how you do your top 5's and don't mention me
Fuck 'em all
Father forgive me, 'cause I ain't perfect
No, no no no
Why is everything wrong?
Oh I can't get it right, I always try to get it right
See I been spendin' these late nights
On girls I never see again
Constantly intoxicated
Only God could save me, yeah
With 'em by the sunrise
One day everyone dies
That's the way the story goes
But now, I can't feel my heart
But I just keep ridin', ridin'
Feel so numb, numb, oh yeah
Father forgive me, 'cause I ain't perfect
No, no no no
Why is everything wrong?
Oh I can't get it right, I always try to get it right

I'm on, like soon as the ice cream truck at the ghetto
Little knucklehead always in trouble soon as I ask shawty her number, fasho
Yeah I get it, then I bone, then I hit it like bone bone
Now you fucking up my zone, my zone, my zone
Said she wait when daddy come home
Told me she ain't got nothing on
I'm talkin' no th-thong. thong thong
Yeah she throwin' that ass back
Hard as a bat, sit on my lap
Fucking with me, ain't nothing better than that
That's a fact, thats a fact
Don't act Hollywood cause I don't act

This my celebration rap, so
We havin' a celebration, love to stay high
We havin' a celebration, love to stay high
We havin' a celebration, love to stay high
We havin' a celebration, love to stay high
I pour up for Pimp C, light up for Soulja Slim
Straight out the gutter, with the rest of the bowlin' pins
Money for days, bitches go both ways
On the road to riches, bitch I got road rage
Got the kush in the swisher, got the pussy, the liquor
Got a silencer on the gun, take it off like a stripper
Yeah, wake up, wake up, I'm goin' at your face make up
These niggas need stitches cause they taking pay cuts
Man somebody tell them hoes it's a celebration
All my niggas got guns no registration
Now go an' light that weed up, I'm Trukfit tee'd up
Hoes down, B's up
Rollin' and chokin' and movin' slow motion, I'm floatin' I'm gone
Rollin' and chokin' and movin' slow motion, I'm floatin' I'm gone
We havin' a celebration, love to stay high

When you come from depression, to the lust for possessions
Gotta make an impression, but you cant wait for your blessing
Model bitches stip naked, while I sip on this Texas
Im pushing this German, jesus piece on my neclace
These niggas gon test ya, and these bitches is reckless
And that money go fast, I hope you paying yo taxes
All the questions they askin, all the cameras thats flashin
All the stress that come with it, its like you hustling backwards
If you aint breaking the bank, so we go hard everyday
And the sacrificial lamb is just the part that you play
When you the first one in yo fam to have the heart to get paid
Had the smarts to switch lanes, had the guts to be brave
Now, and now you a star on the stage
And once they cut on them lights, no turning em off, thats part if the game
Wow, people caught up in your fame
And never will it be the same, this shit is expensive, the price that we pay, thats why I..

Yo, I'm in New York on the block, I know you see it's snowing
Jesus piece got a jesus piece, both of them shit's glowing
Stussy jacket hoodie on, fucking wind blowing
G-star, Jordan 3's, fly like Bowen
And now that I got everbodys fucking attention
Let's address this bitch ass nigga going at Kendrick
Say the album is trash, nigga you full of gas
Poke holes in you, let you fill up a New York cab
Nigga in believes, cause he all in to his feelings
Cause he did 10 years for shooting at the ceiling
Diddy gave you a mill, lil nigga shoulda chill
Cute curly sideburns, talking 'bout he's real
Check my resume, any nigga that want it I bury them
But fuck this nigga he can't get in to America
I'm 'bout to hit Brooklyn, fuck this bitch Erykah
Bust a nut, call a cab and cut
After I tear it up, and we just met today
Gave her the pole, the day after electionday
Bitch was on Section 8, tryna get a Section 8
Already came, it's a wrap like electric tape
And Hurricane said he got this bitch, light out
She fell a sleep then her girl got piped out
And theese the type hoes NBA niggas wife out
And theese my side bitches nigga what's your life 'bout?
Mine's about guns in the stash, the chrys piped out
That's a 300c and chrys iced out
3 kids, all 3 closets niked out
And I'm bipolar, see 40 Glocc, lights out!
Word on the streets, bitch nigga suing me
Sending cops to my door, nigga how you a G?
I ain't beefing with the pigs, this you and me
And I spit the same 16 on your eulogy
Cough up a lung where I'm from, Compton son, ain't nothing nice!
Cough up a lung where I'm from, Compton son, ain't nothing nice!
[Intro:]
Now where's the shit?
The shit?
The shit!
N*gga whatsup man?
Come on kill that noise man, let's just get the shit,
Don't worry, you'll get the shit,
You'll be,
Knee deep in shit!
[Chorus: (The Game)]
I'm a G, you can't see me,
That must be, why you're talkin' (Shut your mouth bitch)
I'm the shit, and you know,
It, never stops, there's no stoppin' (It don't stop *****z)
Light a lo', blow a smoke, oh,
As I cruise, streets of Compton
(Roll out the six fo, six trey, glass house, '57 Chevelot, tell them *****z)
[Verse 1:]
I let the whole world know that I can't be stopped,
Even without Doc I'm still from the (Streets of Compton),
Yeah ***** I said it, and I'ma stay on top,
Like a hoodrat with bomb ass cock,
Run up in 'em like these rap *****z, I ain't gotta clap *****z,
End your career with one line like that *****z,
Hit the switch front and back, make it bounce,
Let it jump, Killa-for-ni-a is where I'm from,
3 wheelin' with the ass out, smoke chronic 'til I pass out,
All the way to my ***** Daz house,
He always gotta big bad bitch from Long Beach,
She a known freak and she gotta long reach,
She gon' touch it, suck it, fuck it, never back down,
'specially when Al Green in the background,
Now bitch hit the weed and turn that ass round,
It's time to bring back Chronic into Doggystyle,
Westcoast *****z still holdin' shit down,
[Chorus: (The Game)]
I'm a G, you can't see me,
That must be, why you're talkin' (Shut your mouth bitch)
I'm the shit, and you know,
It, never stops, there's no stoppin' (It don't stop *****z)
Light a lo', blow a smoke, oh,
As I cruise, streets of Compton
(Roll out the six fo, six trey, glass house, '57 Chevelot, tell them *****z)
[Verse 2:]
I'm back on the cover of the Source and the XXL,
Floatin' all through the (Streets of Compton),
I got more bitches, more plaques, more beef, and more straps,
That's what the fuck I call "Gangsta rap",
I was the Aftermath remedy 'til friends turn enemies,
Streets kept me laced like bloods dipped in hennesse,
You *****z act like the Game can't roll 'em out,
One man show still sell a motherfucker out,
We know Dre still sell a motherfucker out,
'cus everybody here from the (Streets of Compton),
We got crip *****z, blood *****z, assays, asians,
Red and blue laces, tattoos on faces,
I kept you *****z waiting had to take you back to the basics,
Switch the Impala from gold to chrome Daitons,
Everytime your bitch hear my voice she masturbating,
I run though hoes like Walter Payton on the daily,
I got your main bitch swallowing my babies,
[Chorus: (The Game)]
I'm a G, you can't see me,
That must be, why you're talkin' (Shut your mouth bitch)
I'm the shit, and you know,
It, never stops, there's no stoppin' (It don't stop *****z)
Light a lo', blow a smoke, oh,
As I cruise, streets of Compton
(Roll out the six fo, six trey, glass house, '57 Chevelot, tell them *****z)
I'm the Westcoast Rakim, got you *****z blocked in,
Glass house parked sideways on the stock rims,
New school, old school mentality,
Translation - Four pumps and twelve batteries,
Hydraulics make the world go round,
Your girl go down, chronic make your girl slow down,
For she end up like superhead, giving superhead,
Every ***** in the industry now fuck superhead,
And I might just fuck her too,
If I ever catch her sliding or riding through the (Streets of Compton),
Rolling down Green Leaf smoking on that green leaf,
With a Mac 10 like I was born on Queen's Street,
Murder MCs like I was born in Queen's Bridge,
That how I show you palm *****z where the King is,
And you don't wanna play chess on a time clock,
I'm in the Hall Of Fame next to Snoop, behind 'Pac,
I got the whole motherfucking world locked,
[Chorus: (The Game)]
I'm a G, you can't see me,
That must be, why you're talkin' (Shut your mouth bitch)
I'm the shit, and you know,
It, never stops, there's no stoppin' (It don't stop *****z)
Light a lo', blow a smoke, oh,
As I cruise, streets of Compton
(Roll out the six fo, six trey, glass house, '57 Chevelot, tell them *****z)
[Outro:]
Everybody wanna know what the fuck is going on,
Am I signed to Aftermath? Interscope? What's up with Geffen?
I'ma just say it like this:
One day I walked in the motherfuckin' house,
And all my shit was gone.
Yeah, Fort Knocks, Aftermath, Compton to Jersey
What y'all fools know about perculatin on lo-los?
Mics and six-fo's nigga
Ha ha, no more hand claps, please nigga
Here we go - Just Blaze!
To all my niggas on the porch gettin they hair braided
Cornrowed by a L.A. bitch
And I can't forget, my niggas ridin the train, Yankee fitted
Snub nose under that Pelle shit
I love New York, but gangbangin that's L.A. shit
And I'm proud of it, spit it through the wire so the crowd love it
Haters you know who you are, you can turn it down, fuck it {*volume fades*}
{*volume rises*} I can shoot a video to it and spend half the budget
I'm gangster, let the 40 cal blow in public
More hatred inside my soul than 'Pac had for Delores Tucker
Every time one of my niggas get shot, the more I suffer
Cause we trapped inside a world where you forced to die for your colors
I seen it all through the Range tints
Got niggas doin life in the state pen
So I dread like Jamaicans
If I die for one of my statements
Then break up the streets of Compton
Spread my blood in the pavement
Believe me
Niggas keep sayin they gon' heat me up
Talkin that shit like they gon' lay me down
But when I come through strapped to see what's up
Niggas really don't want no parts of me pal
Believe me
Niggas keep sayin they gon' heat me up
Talkin that shit like they gon' lay me down
But when I come through strapped to see what's up
Niggas really don't want no parts of me pal
Who I gotta talk to, who I gotta write
Get my Reebok deal done or I'm stayin in Air Nikes, aight?
I handle bars, you ain't gotta ride a bike
To beat Game in his skills, here go some trainin wheels
Let's roll, through the City of God, where niggas trained to kill
We'll chop you up a hundred times worse than the Haitians will
F'real, nah f'real I need a track homey
Dre we too close, ain't no turnin back homey
Deal with it, I'mma be here for ten years
Spittin like the ghost of Eric Wright and Big here
Let me paint this picture while you sit here
Thinkin in the back of your mind, this is the shit, yeah
I spit for niggas doin 25 on they fifth year
Ready to throw a nigga off the fifth tier
Them white boys in the Abercrombie & Fitch gear
And every nigga who ever helped me to get here
Believe me
Niggas keep sayin they gon' heat me up
Talkin that shit like they gon' lay me down
But when I come through strapped to see what's up
Niggas really don't want no parts of me pal
Believe me
Niggas keep sayin they gon' heat me up
Talkin that shit like they gon' lay me down
But when I come through strapped to see what's up
Niggas really don't want no parts of me pal
It go one brick, two brick, the boy movin weight
Now three bricks, four bricks, I'm drivin upstate
Five bricks, six bricks, the nigga got cake
Not rap money, but money been wrapped since eighty-eight
Look at the world we live in, niggas steady hate
'til the Heckler and Koch, leave 'em chopped up like Freddie's face
Niggas catchin feelings cause I'm about millions
And out of all the newcomes out, my flow the illest
You a close second nigga, banana to a gorilla
Put us in the same cage, and I'mma have to peel him
The best of both worlds, rappin and drug dealin
Run and tell Lateef I came to burn down the village
The head honcho, starin out the third story window
Of my Beverly Hills condo
Two long-ass Heats, I call 'em Shaq and Alonzo
You niggas want me out of L.A., geah I know
Believe me
Niggas keep sayin they gon' heat me up
Talkin that shit like they gon' lay me down
But when I come through strapped to see what's up
Niggas really don't want no parts of me pal
Believe me
Niggas keep sayin they gon' heat me up
Talkin that shit like they gon' lay me down
But when I come through strapped to see what's up
Niggas really don't want no parts of me pal
[Chorus 1 x2: Drake]
You tryin to come up, I am the come up
I be standin right here when the sun up
You gettin done up if you niggaz try and run up
You livin good, go on 'head, throw your one up
[Chorus 2: Drake]
And scream out bla-bladow, bla-bla-bladow
Bla-bla-bladow, how ya like me now?
I'm like bla-bladow, bla-bla-bladow
Bla-bla-bladow, how ya like me now?
It go bla-bladow, bla-bla-bladow
Bla-bla-bladow, how ya like me now?
I'm like bla-bladow, bla-bla-bladow
Bla-bla-bladow, how ya like me now?
[The Game:]
My nigga Funeral Fad told me back in oh-three
Rap ain't nuttin but cash money bitches, foreign cars and trees
Cristal by the cases, bad bitches by the flocks
And I know I promised my niggaz I'd never leave the block; but
Shit changes - I done been through six Ranges
Hand on the Eagle, yeah I got them Mike Vick fingers
Throwin bullets on par with the accuracy
Hit your whole faculty, like ain't nobody jackin me
Before you do, you be layin in a box
While Ja (da) "Kiss That Ass Goodbye" {MUAH} L.O.X.
First shot leave them niggaz in shock
That second shot, that's when that body drop (you heard me?)
And niggaz still askin 'bout "Detox"
I'll tell you if you tell me who killed 'Pac; aight then~!
I'm at this Pacquiao fight then, with Tyson
The way he's stickin and movin the knife, Floyd might win
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
[Lifestyle:]
Yeah, uhh
Testarossas, keep an extra toaster
It's Hub City finest, they respect the mostest
My nigga Game do that, my nigga Tyga do that
Heard about the new cat, I whipped the Range through that
I'm in Toronto, DeMar got a condo
Sittin courtsides with Drake, Hector and Rondo
Bitches know my name, it's Lifestyle, she fuck with that
Dick too big like my lifestyle, you fuck with that?
Poppin champagne, we do the damn thing
Standin on the couch, it's money Game, that's the campaign
Big in my pocket, Obama on my wrist
At the Ronald Reagan Airport, yeah, I'm on my shit
Louis Vuitton luggage peanut butter with the red wheels
Started when the "RED" album dropped, I'm gettin head still
In the club, lookin past you niggaz
These bitches gas them niggaz, Drizzy ask them niggaz
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]

Yo Dre, I thought I was dead
West coast
I'm the doctor's advocate
Nigga Dre shot ya
Brought me back from the dead
That's why they call him the doctor
The mavs gon' drop em
If 50 ain't rockin' wit him no more
It's ok, I get it poppin'
The whole club rockin' like da 6-4 Impala
Drink Cris throw it up call the shit hydraulics
Then piss in the cup call the shit Hipnotiq
I bleed Compton, spit crack, the shit chronic
And you new niggas ain't shit but new niggas
Baped n ape shoe niggas I'm talkin' to you nigga
Bounce in the 6-4 throwin' up west side man
Sell another five million albums, yes I am
Fresh like damn dis nigga did it again
A hundred thousand on his neck, LA above the brim
Inside the Lambo', shotgun wit Snoop
What would the muthafuckin' west coast be without
One crip and one blood?
One blood, one blood, one blood
Blood, blood, blood
One blood, one blood, one blood, one blood, one blood
I'm from the west side of the 6-4 Impala
When niggas say, Where you from?
We'll never say holla
Bandana on the right side, gun on the left side
Niggas in New York know how to throw up the west side
Word to Eazy, I'm so ill believe me
I made room for Jeezy
But the rest of you niggas better be glad you breathing
All I need is one reason
I'm the King and Dre said it the west coast need me
I don't know why you niggas keep tryin' me
Everybody know that I'm the heir to the Aftermath dynasty
And I ain't got to make shit for the club
What DJ gon' turn down the 38 snub?
You 38 and you still rappin'? Uhh
I'm 26 nigga, so is the dubs
On the 07 Hummer hop out
Nobody guards, when the chronic
Smoke clear, all you gon' see is one blood
One blood, one blood, one blood
Blood, blood, blood
One blood, one blood, one blood, one blood, one blood
I ain't got beef wit 50, no beef wit J
What's beef when you gettin' head in the 6 trey?
And the double game change, I keep em on display
Black t-shirt so all you see is the A
Turn on the TV and all you see is the A
You niggas better make up a dance and try to get radio play
Keep on snappin' your fingers, I ain't goin' away
I don't regret what I spit, cause I know what I say
And niggas talk about me, they don't know when to stop
I got the Louis Vuitton belt buckle holdin' the glock
No beam, no silencer, I know when to pop
I wait till Lil' Jon come on and let off a shot
I had the number one Billboard spot
Niggas stepped on my fingers and I climbed right back to the top
I'm BIG, I'm Cube, I'm Nas, I'm Pac
This ain't shit but a warning till my album drop
One blood, one blood, one blood, one blood
Blood, blood, blood
One blood, one blood, one blood, one blood, one blood
One blood, one blood, one blood, one blood
Blood, blood, blood
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In the Bay, our chains hang, L.A. they can't bang
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In L.A. they havin' problems, the Bay we pop collars
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In the Bay we pop hollows, L.A. they pop hollows
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In the Bay we pop bottles, L.A. they pop bottles
They can't cop what the bricks'll cost
But we stay in the lane to maintain in the 6 to floss
Leather gloves with the tips to toss
But the money was made from conversation had to clip the boss
Smash down at the V.I.P.
Street smarts is crucial for young niggaz in the CX-3
Drop Jag with the price to pay
'Cause the bags was heavy my chain swangin' like a ice capade
Got the feds lookin' twice this way
'Cause we shuffle the P's in different places that the [unverified] name
Compton to Fillmoe man the game is real
When you turn 15 get your stainless steel
Whole squad been trained to kill, we official
And switch to get rich now we after the meals
Hard times got cakes for 3
When it's havin' a bundle we break bread for the safe and flee nigga
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In the Bay, our chains hang, L.A. they can't bang
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In L.A. they havin' problems, the Bay we pop collars
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In the Bay we pop hollows, L.A. they pop hollows
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In the Bay we pop bottles, L.A. they pop bottles
I got guns, guns, guns, guns, guns all over the club
We in V.I.P. strapped, security know that
25 deep, guns up under the throwback
That new R. Kelly shit sound like Bobby Womack
Black Wall Street in HURR, nigga where the hoes at
We got sour diesel, three cases of Hypnotiq
And more guns than the Nickerson Projects
Niggaz don't want beef with me
'Cause they know they gotta pay for talkin' shit but the sheets is free
And ain't nuttin' to shoot the club up
You don't want drama in this motherfucker throw them dubs up
Jacob got the wrists on chill
And N.W.A. chain glow like the memory of Ill Will
Relax your mind and let your drawers feel free
You're now rollin' to the sound of the Game and JT
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In the Bay, our chains hang, L.A. they can't bang
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In L.A. they havin' problems, the Bay we pop collars
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In the Bay we pop hollows, L.A. they pop hollows
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In the Bay we pop bottles, L.A. they pop bottles
But you can't come with the rest of her friends
Cause you know I'm a boss and won't play cause she short on my ends
Make rounds from the back of the Benz
With the [unverified] that kid with frog eyes with the corners to bend
The things we go through I'm beatin' ya brains
Got some homies next do' and I picked up the Game
While they knockin' on the do' I get deep in ya dame
Gotta charge you a G just for speakin' my name
I'm not eatin' your chocha or payin' for the coach ma
I'm a pimp like 50, the nigga to leave you broke ma
6 in the mornin', you stretchin' on the sofa
Singin', "Ain't No Nigga" like Foxy Brown and Hova
I fuck 'em dogstyle with Billys and Novas
With or without chaffeurs, I make 'em fuck the both of us
You know what it is, the gangster's back
And I keep my banger at where my chain hang at
I'm ghetto
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In the Bay, our chains hang, L.A. they can't bang
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In L.A. they havin' problems, the Bay we pop collars
Compton to Fillmore here we go again

[Chorus]
Ol' English (la-lala-la-la-la-la)
Ridin' by gettin' high
Smokin' on that chronic drinkin' Ol' English
Rags tied gangs signs Letters on my hat in
Ol' English (la-lala-la-la-la-la)
Drive by homicide
R.I.P. tats in Ol' English Westside 'til I die
Niggas pourin' out that Ol' English (la-la la-la-la-la-la)
[Verse 1]
Once upon a time in the projects yo
I watched my uncle Greg put D's on his six-fo'
I washed it on Monday so he bought me a gold chain
Shopped crack and watched "Colors" and I soaked up game
Drove the Impala on his lap that was my role model
Used to let me kill the corner of his 40-ounce bottle
On the weekend him and my pops flashed the 'Vette
Till one weekend my uncle got stabbed to death
He got murdered by a fiend my pops ain't like that
He was from Nutty Block they used to call him Maniac
Crazy ass nigga wit' a Black Panther tat
Kill a nigga cross him out on his Compton hat
Told me when I got older I would understand that
It's blood in blood out and ain't no turnin' back
Few summers went by and we moved across the tracks
13 that's when I had my first
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
I was the first nigga wit' a Starter jacket on the block
Used to build model cars and let the motherfuckers hop
Moms banged Hoover Crip she was known for sellin' rocks
Let me collect the 40-ounce bottles in the dope spot
Bought my first Converse thought I couldn't be stopped
When I creased up my khakis and threw on my Ronnie Lott
Used to think that I was hard so I stole my brother's glock
And that's the day my life changed 'cause that night he got shot
Killed by another crip over his Rolex watch
I got high for three years off that Chronic from the Doc
I was drinkin' 40-ounces a lot
And every liquor store in Compton sold out the day Eazy dropped
I start bangin' red laces in my adidas
Drinkin' out a brown paper bag on my first drive-by
I was a menace to society
But I never left fingerprints on my
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
I got a lot of dead homies some blood some crip
This is life stop watchin' that "Boyz N The Hood" shit
You see this red rag hangin' out of my jeans?
I went to twenty funerals by the age of nineteen
Then I went to college basketball was my dream
Quit the team 'cause I rather shoot rock wit' the fiends
Wanted to be Freeway Rick
He showed me how to turn a stolen 5.0 into a brick
Bought a Cadillac thought I was rich bangin' DJ Quik
On Crenshaw got jacked for my shit
Took a long chronic hit and thought about the time
When I was 12 years old and I emptied my first clip
Hit my first switch same night fucked my first bitch
Thought I was dreamin' till I pinched her tits
She caught a stray bullet ridin' shotgun in my shit
So I got her name tatted in
[Chorus]
[Repeated: x4]
Ol' English

I woke up out that coma 2001
'bout the same time Dre dropped 2001
Three years later the album is done
Aftermath presents: Nigga Witta Attitude, Volume One
Rap critics politickin, wanna know the outcome
Ready to Die, Reasonable Doubt and Doggystyle in one
I feel like 'Pac after the Snoop Dogg trial was done
Dre behind that G series and All Eyez on Me
I watched the death of a dynasty, so I told Vibe Magazine
Workin' with Dr. Dre was a (dream)
I had visions of makin a classic, then my world turned black
Like I was starin' out of Stevie Wonder's glasses
It's kinda hard to imagine, like Kanye West
Coming back from his fatal accident to beatmaking and rapping
But, we the future, Whitney Houston told me that
And it's gon' take more than a bullet in the heart to hold me back
Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
Cause Martin Luther King had a (dream)
Aaliyah had a (dream), Left Eye had a (dream)
So I reached out to Kanye and (I brought you all my dreams)
(Cause I love you, I love you, I love you)
I had dreams of fuckin' a R&B; bitch like Mya
When I saw that ass on the front of that King
Read the article in the magazine, she loved gangsters, loved nasty things
So I'm in the glass house having nasty dreams
Good girls never give it up
But anything is possible, if 50 fucked Vivica
Hurdled life's obstacles, found my way through the maze
Then joy turned to pain like Frankie Beverly and Maze
Used to dream of being Unsigned Hype
'til I was crushed by Dave Mays, almost let my pen fall asleep on the page
Daydreamin' yesterday, dozin' off backstage
I thought I saw Eazy talking to Jam Master Jay
So I walked over, heard Jam Master say
"It's a hard knock life, then you pass away"
They say sleep is the cousin of death, so my eyes wide open
Cause a dream is kin to your last breath
Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
Cause Martin Luther King had a (dream)
Aaliyah had a (dream), Left Eye had a (dream)
So I reached out to Kanye and (I brought you all my dreams)
(Cause I love you, I love you, I love you)
The dream of Huey Newton that's what I'm livin' through
The dream of Eric Wright, that's what I'm givin you
Who walked through the White House without a business suit
Compton hat, jheri curl drippin on Ronald Reagan's shoes
Gave Mike Lem my demo, came here to pay my dues
Started off with Whoo Kid, then I start blazin' Clue
It was all a dream like Big said it'd be
Don't sleep on me homey, I bring nightmares to reality
Rap phenomenon, defyin' the rules of gravity
Studied all the classics, start revisin' my strategy
Cause Marshall Mathers made it, Curtis Jackson made it
Head in the clouds, wonderin' where the hell Marvin Gaye went
How do I say this? I'm livin' for my son
But I can't figure out, why I'm at my temple with this gun
Wake up to a Jesus piece like a catholic nun
The war to be a rap legend, has just begun
Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
Cause Martin Luther King had a (dream)
Aaliyah had a (dream), Left Eye had a (dream)
So I reached out to Kanye and (I brought you all my dreams)
(Cause I love you, I love you, I love you)
This song is dedicated to Yetunde Price
The sister of Venus and Serena Williams
Who was slain during a gang shootout in Compton
Sunday, September 14th, 2003 - rest in peace
It's that, it's that, it's that, it's that...chronic, chronic, chronic, chronic
It's that, it's that, it's that, it's that...hydrolex, drolex, drolex, drolex
It's that, it's that, it's that, it's that...Westside, Westside, Westside, Westside
It's that, it's that, it's that, it's that...Compton, Compton, Compton, Compton
It's not that I can't stop, It's that I won't stop, I make it hot (I do it)
I'll be on top, as soon as the beat drop, I'll make the whole club rock (I do it)
Lace my Air Ones up, put my gun up
I don't need that I'm riding wit Dre
Who don't love us, every hood throwin' they dubs up
Who the fuck why'all thought was comin' after Young Buck
Hip hops worst nightmare, Mr. Gangsta Rap is back in black Nike Airs
You want war, we can settle it right here
I got a squad, E-V-E and Busta Rhymes yeah
Or you could give me ya bitch, her with the light hair
Sit her next to these yellow bottles, tea right there
Matter fact I'll take you in the back
You in the hat, and you in the blue and the black
Lets have a gangsta party
Somebody lean over and tell Banks to order another case of fortys
Yo Doc give them a coke with that, wake up the west coast is back
[Chorus:]
(I can take you hiyaaaah)
Show you how that low rider bounce off the flo' - You ain't know?
(I can take you hiyaaaah)
It's the motherfuckin chronic nigga that's whatsup - roll that blunt
(I can take you hiyaaaah)
G-Unit, Shady Aftermath I'm the motherfuckin Game and
(I can take you hiyaaaah)
Like Dre did, I created a buzz without a single like N.W.A. did
From the hood -liquor- store to the state pen
This is gin and juice
The doc made the club R.O.C. without Timbaland boots
First nigga to put drolex on a Bentley coupe
You want to pimp? I perm my shit up like snoop (Westside)
Chronic 2005 motherfucker, put the purple in the dutch
"Let it Burn" like Usher girl
Drop down, do the eagle, fuck that
Real niggaz just pull up they pants and lean back girl
Make 50 spill his cris, he'll call you a bitch
I'ma call you and hit , you can ya girlfriend, we can make it a flick
I got the lollipop if you want to lick
Or you can take a ride on the magic stick
[Chorus:]
Put 25's on the hummer, why not
I'ma be here for the next 10 summers
Drop me in the 4th quarter I'm fuckin' up they money
I don't need sound scan I'm doin' my own numbers
When that impala bounce you can see the chrome under
I got em' in every color yea I'm a known stunner
When I hit a switch I get higher than long jumpers
Low ridin' with a hood rat or a grown woman
And I'll do anything but I won't fuck Mariah
Even if she had Ashanti butt naked in bed
'Cause she got a forehead just like Tyra
I can say what the fuck I want, you thought Dre retired
Left me in 6-4 his Dayton wires
These niggaz is a waste of rhymin', Doc got something to say be quiet
Look out for Detox
[Chorus:]
Baby this is real shit
my record sell slow imma show you my dick (reapets 7x)
[The Game]
Hit a breakdown
No 400 bars yet, I don't need that
I'm gas, your whole click is ass, I mean that.
G-Unot cocksucker, better believe that
I say it one time, watch the whole world scream back
G-U-N-O-T, now thats for Billboard, rest in peace
And since my nigga died, I been stress no sleep
Contemplating suicide in my Lexus jeep
I tried twice but I couldn't make my death complete
I guess you could say Mya got the best of me
Came back from the dead to address the beef
Kiss my converse bitch and accept defeat
Cause I hate it when bullies try to test the weak
Thats when I go bishop and juice and start flexin heat
You could get it in the stomach just like Raheem
Cause running with a snitch is not quite my thing
I tried to take Buck with me, but he stayed on the scene
Guess all I can do now is pray for Supreme
While I finish my next album, 5 million and countin
Anticipating, tellin the world I did it without him
If Aftermath was a family that didn't have a mother
I'd be Dre's newborn, you'd be the jealous older brother
Yea, daddy love us but in the meanwhile
You talkin behind his back and in his face you smile
You moved out the house, You a failure now
And lil' Game grew up to be a problem child
I whip yo head boy, that's for Kanye West
I whip yo head boy, with the back of my tech
Yeap, your fuckin group fell flat without me
You mad, what you gonna do rap about me?
Your bars is park garbage, hooks is mediocre
And your new shoes look like Reebok pennyloafers
Try to walk in my shoes a block
Hurricanes in stores the day after Christmas, nigga fuck Reeboks
You a steroid addict, you need Detox
Hopefully you make it out in time to be on Detox
Cause BlackWallstreet expandin, yea I bought 3 blocks
My CL so smooth, it should of came with Pete Rock
And lets not forget who made me hot
It was Dr. Dre that took me out the weed spot.
You want credit, forget it, I did it on my own
Gave you 300 bars, then said I'm gone
But I'm back, this is rap and a fact is a fact
They say once you turn snitch, you never go back
Heres a picture of Ja Rule, motherfucker hold that
What goes around comes around, get used to the gold plaques
Homie got cheese, but he dont feed no rats
I show the world my dick if Lloyd Banks go plat
I'm lyrically insane, Lloyd Banks know that
He told me I was like a Big Daddy Kane throwback
Started with 1 brick, built my own company
And don't spread news about it unless it come from me
Guess whos the boss, nigga my squad deep
But Glasses Malone is not signed to BlackWallstreet
Nigga don't, don't, don't, don't, don't believe the hype
Hear that Mike?
And don't be alarmed, this is not a diss
But missusing my logo kinda got me pissed
And I got enough beef, now Lil' Eazy dissin
He don't write his own raps, so I gotta forgive him
I got love for ya pops and I always will
So on behalf of Eric Wright, my nigga you gotta chill
I'm the reason you new westcoast nigga's got a deal
While I was doin mixtapes, they was watching College Hill
For real, you mothafucka's ain't got half my skill
I run this shit like OJ and pass for the bills
Trying so hard to be a gangsta, nigga you seethrough
Posing like 50 on the cover of the GQ
Button up shirt with the cut off sleeves
I got twin desert eagles, nigga suck on these
I got that CEO flow, yea my bars are sweet
Like Hova in Takeover, chewin out Mobb Deep
Like Pac on Hit Em Up, chewin out Mobb Deep
Don't one of you niggas got sickas, fuck your talk is cheap
When I see you, and I'm gonna see you
Imma strip you down asshole naked and thats how Imma leave you
Then Imma find Havoc, make him walk through Queens nude
With Black Wallstreet tattooed on his back
Nigga's signed to G-unit, now they bustin guns
But last week it was: "My nigga Game, what up dun?"
See thats what the fuck I mean, you can't trust these rap niggas
And you wonder why I always say fuck these rap niggas
So Imma break it down for MC's and friends
If you don't hear your name, let the beef begin
Ain't got shit against Hov, I like the nigga style
Nas is my nigga, I been bangin him for a while
I fuck with Fat Joe, he got the streets locked
And thats the same reason I fuck with Kiss and D-Block
Place Eminem in the number 3 spot
And Snoop is like my big brother, we both raised by the Doc.
Young Jeezy you hot, we both new to this
While I'm in the ATL, shout out to Ludacris
Cause your uncle Scarface show me that crime pays
Just like Paul Wall got me "sittin sideways"
And I can't forget about the homie Mike Jones
Who? Mike Jones, Skeet screw the fuckin song
I fuck with Slim Thug and my nigga Bun B
Can't do that without saying free pimp c
And thats the reason why 50 try to pimp me
So I went window shoppin and bought 2 Bentlys
I'm in the drivers seat, motherfucker don't tempt me
Turnin Spider Loc against me, cause your scared to come get me
'cause know whats up, Bloods still got love for em'
Come to the block, I'll shake off the rub for em'
Ask for G-unit, motherfucker its a rap
Ma$e made it out alive, thank God for that
If Dipset don't get you, Jesse Jackson will
And if all else fails, I'll see you in hell
Wear that G-unit spinner when you come to L.A.
I have a nigga parkin cars, dressed up like valet
He gonna turn back pastor when the gun in his face
The real chain still in Chicago when I'm takin the fake
You can call who you want, I ain't givin back shit
Unless Olivia show the whole world she got a dick
Can't seem to save her life, but she talk a lot of shit
And I want my 10 G's cause Yayo caught a brick
I guess my G-Unot tattoo was a smart move
Cause in the end you lost a 100 Mil. to a cartoon
3 years after you got tatted by cartoon
The beef is over, G-Unit is gonna fall apart soon
Hahahahaha
Faggot ass niggas
I guess I win nigga
Life is a game of chess nigga...
Some King, Some Queens
Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo, Young Buck, Pastor fuckin Ma$e
You niggas is pawns
50, or Boo Boo, or Curtis, or Chicken Little, Hahaha
Stop Snitchin, Stop Lying!, In Stores December 6th
The DVD, Its a tell all motherfuckers
Yea, my documentaries be better than your movies nigga, Hahaha
I drove by your house nigga
Go buy the DVD, $16,99 nigga
At your local record store, Blockbuster, Sam Goody, Warehouse
Shout out to the moms and pops, for helping me slay dem faggots.
G-gu-g-g-gu, G-gu-g-g-gu, G-gu-g-g-gu, G-UNOT! Hahahaha
Pop off nigga, Hahahaha, Pop off
It's me, The G-A-M-E, gone
[Lil Wayne]
Money to be made best believe a nigga glockin'
I run it myself like a quarterback option
I pitch her ten G's tell a bitch to go shoppin'
She buy herself some clothes and she brought me back a chopper
See niggas tryna kick it but no I don't play soccer
I'm all about my cake I'm tryna marry Betty Crocker
A package on the way you know my whip game proper
And off of one key I see seventy thousand dollars
Now I was shootin' dice smokin' on a joint
I bet with Yo Gotti he hit five straight points
We over here hustlin' we over here grindin'
You rap about money and a nigga might sign you
Rap about me and a nigga might find you
Banana in your ass with your head right behind you
Dope game bitch let his mama worry about him
You could holla at me or Feat
[The Game]
As if he fuckin' come at us with real murder shit
John Mohammed Lee Malvo when me and the kid split
Surgical when I'm in a convertible state of mind
Lock me in the pen watch the murder rate decline
I'll do mine like Shyne soon as I hit the bricks
You better have fake on that Bad Boy shit
I got niggas that'll kidnap kids to get dough
And dress up like SpongeBob in a six-four
It's fucked up what they did so I'm on one knee
God bless the brother of rich fo'
Ain't no love lost I'm still Don sippin'
Readin' the LA Times and Louis Vuitton slippin'
Sittin' behind bars for the simple fact that the
Hip Hop police is drivin' behind Scar's
Air Force One's in the Bentley GT
It's the reason I'm still rap's MVP
[Malice]
Ugh.. so much glamour that I can't stand the
Bright from the ice the chain xenon lamp ya
Impression in your mind like a freeze-frame camera
The white tee tight like you seen on Pampers
What's under the couch probably free off santa
Whatever it cost baby we got answers
Line outside full of jojo dancers
We Got It 4 Cheap that's the re-up anthem
By far the coldest '06 Lotus
Zero to sixty hokus-pokus
The feds don't know so they stick they noses
While we off the coast proposin' toast-es
Hoes and mo' shit the family close-knit
And deep like the who too you cockroaches
Just like the flow the fo's ferocious
I'll tuck you in homie buenas noches
Can't wait 'til we make real love
Because these conjugal visits just ain't enough
I'm really looking forward to a future for us
Baby don't worry 'bout it
I'mma beeee right here, waitin on you
Even took a second job
So they won't take the clause and put a lean on the
House
I know it's gonna be a while before you get out, ooh
Baby don't worry 'bout it (don't worry)
I'mma beeee right here, waitin on you
And them dudes you ran with are foul
They been tryna get at me, ever since you been down
Even my girls are tellin me, I should end it all now
Baby don't worry about it
I'mma be
All I can think about is that honey complexion
And the way your skin glow when you slippin on them Dior dresses
I know you wonderin why I got you a Smith 'n Wesson
Cause them niggas in the hood is the reason we stressin
I miss that gangsta love and that lil' affection
Them butter soft lips when you kissin my chest and
Mary I put nuttin above you
And behind that vest I got a heart ma gangstas need love too
Some think the worst of you
They portray you as a man, it's not that far from the truth
You were caught up in the game and now it's, caught up to you
Baby don't worry about it
I'mma be right here, waitin on you
It used to be caramel skin tones, Sprewell rims on
Glass house, ass out, Jacob watch, gemstones
Bandanna, Nike Airs, tennis bracelet, wife hair
Black rag, do or die, .45 right here
Every time I was down, you was always right there
Whenever visitin hours came, I know my wife there
So pink diamonds right here, chain hang, ice there
The reason for my tattooed tear - I need you to hold me down
I'll be waiting on you (I'll)
I'll be waiting on you (I'ma be right here whenever you call me babe)
I'll be waiting on you (ooh-oh)
Baby don't worry about it
I'mma be right here, waitin on you
I'm locked up countin the days down
Tryna hold my head cause the penitentiary ain't no playground
I'm dyin in here and I don't know how you stay down
In the shootin range twice a week bustin that trey-pound
I would never ask you to wait around
But how do a white sandy beach in St. Tropez sound?
And no more outta town trips on that Greyhound
Just me hittin like a beat from Dr. Dre, out
I'll be waiting on you (I'll be waiting)
I'll be waiting on you (I'ma be right here, for you ba-by)
I'll be waiting on you (I'll)
Baby don't worry about it (don't worry babe)
I'mma be right here (I'ma be) waitin on you
I'll be waiting on you (I'ma be right here waitin for you baby)
I'll be waiting on you (you know I will)
I'll be waiting on you (whenever you need me baby)
Baby don't worry about it (I'll be right here, I'll be right here)
I'mma be right here, waitin on you (don't you worry)
I'm lookin' for a future with you baby
Wanna see you real soon, real soon, real soon
I'll be right there, I'll be right there
(Baby don't worry about it)
Don't worry, don't worry
(I'ma be right here, waitin' on you)
Don't worry
Turn the beat up, yeah
New york, New york, wake up LA
Wave hi to the Chi, let's get right today
I heard them lil' niggas takin' their life away
I heard a couple lil' niggas got life today
Is it farrakhan, buddha, or christ today?
She on her knees so she know what it's like to pray
She got religious so she doin' it twice a day
I strap up, no I ain't throwin' dice today
When you got money on yo head it's a price to pay
And it get cold in the hood, put your ice away
They locked rick ross up and they ain't give him no bail
But a cracker shoot a whole church up and it's "oh well"
Oh well, oh well
Hang him with a confederate flag in his cell
Let him sit there and rot 'til his body turns to bones
Just remember who casted the first stone
New york, New york, good mornin' LA
Say hi to the Chi, celebrate to the Bay
No hesitation like steph, shoot it right in your face
Cause I'm a golden state warrior strapped with a K
How's it land of the free, when we're trapped in a cage?
Some shit just never make sense like magic and aids
Some shit just never make sense like bashin' the gays
Obama must be in the city, it's traffic today
Niggas trappin' today just like back in the day
We like roc-a-fella records, we packagin' yay
And that dirty sprite 2 shit slappin' today
We got these niggas boxed in like cassius clay
And my feregammo belt where that ratchet stay
Cause the police killing too many blacks today
I wake up in the morning like who gon' pass away?
Who gon' blast today? who gon' have to pray?"
New york, New york
Good morning LA my nigga haze blew him and his wife away
Hey, Skee, tell 'em I'm goin' away for a while (A Million) Motherfukka's wanna see me dead
(A Million) Motherfukka's wanna see me in the fed's
(A Million) Bitches wanna give me head
(A Million) Dollars in my bank account
(A Million) Soundscan the first week out
(A Million) Motherfukka's on my dick
(A Million) Motherfukka's talking shyt
Hit a break down...
I'm the king, and you better respect it
All I need is Beyonce, and a Roc-a-fella necklace
Nigga you can "check up on it", I'm a Slim Thug
Cincinnati fitted, wit the red and black brim blood
Gave nigga's 300 bars, two mixtapes, and a DVD
I did it for the C.P.T.
Did it for New York, did it for Chi-town
Ran through hip-hop, and made these nigga's lie down
I'm going away for awhile, call it a California vacation
I call it a Bentley with a smile
GOD bless the child, wit incredible style
Nigga sicker than West Nile, who king of the West now
I'm putting my vest down, nigga's ain't going to kill shit
Shut the fuck up, nigga you ain't going to kill shit
Rappers don't kill rappers, guns kill rappers
And I be wit real crips, real bloods, real clappers
Fuck rappin, these nigga's will push ya grill backwards
Faster than Iraqis when Bush attacking
My flow semi-automatic, blhow
Touching pussies is my job, you a bitch, this is sexual harrassment
Nigga get a lawyer, when 'The Game' coming for ya
My jab, like Zab on the chin of De La Hoya
I'm the golden boy, and I'm making Hova noise
Got the whole world clapping, just like the Nolia Boys
Since a juvenile, I had to prove my style
Went from Kayslay to DJ Clue, and blhow
20 Magazine covers, nigga look at me now
You need a hot 16?.. I need 100 thou
Cause half of these rap nigga's just be running they mouth
The other half, in the ATL runnin' the south
10 Mill in the bank, 7 bedroom house
I'm rich, so on my 30th birthday I'm out
Nigga, I'm so ahead of time, and I spit better lines
Better rhymes everytime, nigga's hate on me so much, I feel like I'm Kevin Federline
Fuck it im rich, for nothing, tell the media to get off of my dick
You wit me, my next album going to sell like Britney
I beat on these rap nigga's like Bobby do Whitney
No more drama, no more beef wit 50
And if you just tuning in, welcome to the 360 (welcome to the 360, welcome to the 360)
Right back where I started, in Compton, taking out the garbage
Where Crips and Bloods shoot it out like Pearl Harbor
That was '95, when Cube was in his prime
You brought yo Lethal Injection, and I brought mine
Rewind to '89, got my first mixtape
My brother brought it for me, they use to call him Big Face
But now, we ain't brothers, nigga we ain't shit
And you living in my shadow like Marcus Vick
And I heard about yo little rappers talking shit
Stay out my family bidness, or you get a coffin quick
I ain't change, same nigga that got off them bricks
Got signed to Dr.Dre cause his bars is sick
Getting head on the road, cause his cars is sick
And he whop so good, I had to pause this shit
I told 'em bomp, slow down baby
Got to get this shit firm like Foxy, NaS and AZ
She said 'fuck you,pay me
So I left her in AZ
That's what I get for letting her listen to my Jay-Z
Fuck a bitch, give me a 40, I'll take that
Dress up for the grammy's, but I still don't drive maybach's
Nigga I'm gangster, and homey don't play dat
Stand way back, or get ya ass clapped ASAP
Nigga this the payback, you want beef.. say that
I'll have a hundred hurricane hoodies where you lay at
Get yo whole clique wet, making up crip sets
Nigga got ran outta New York by Dipset
Then he got ran out of Compton by my set
Banned from Watts, can't even walk through his projects
Nigga so lame, talking he gangbang
Won't bust a shot, and the nigga know where I hang
I'm Big Daddy Kane, and the platinum chain
The fact remains, the game don't rap for fame
Game rap for fun, Game blast his gun
the game gotta rap in tongue, so that bastards done
Be easy, I might give you a pass this once
I'm ready to die, but I don't want a bastard son
Nigga, I rap too good, and I'm back in the hood
On the same couch, I put my demo in a package for Sug
After one meeting, I was right back in the hood
Red bandana hanging, selling crack in the hood
Now it's, Aftermath for good...
Any nigga mention Dre, get a Desert Eagle shoved in his fucking face
How that taste?
Blow yo shit out fa'real, Nigga im for real
Call Nelly or Paul Wall, tell 'em make you a grill
I cook beef, like a steak on a grill
Got the clipse on hold, but I ain't Pharrell
Nigga I'm fa'real.. my flow ill, like smoke in ya lungs
I Spit sharp like a razorblade under my tongue
Nigga, I'm number one, motherfukka bar none
Who else kick knowlegde outside of Hova and the God Son
We can go bar for bar, cocksucker drop some(tm)
Watch me Take Flight like Tom Cruise in The Top Gun
You might win some, but you just lost one
I beat on these lil nigga's like Dr. Dre drums
Look at these motherfukka's trying to prove theyselves
Thinking beefing wit hurricane going to boost they sales
Never that, motherfukka, I'm a clever cat
Kanye West in slacks, nigga, I'm as fresh as that
Ask Dre, ask Snoop, I'm nice
I'm Cube, I'm Jacob, I put rappers on "Ice"
A skee , let me ask you a question
If you take the 120 bars, put it with the 240 bars
Then add the 360 bars, wit one Kevin Federline, what you get?
(A Million) Haha.. lets get the fuck outta here man..
Go find something to do
I'm a G, you can't see, me
That must be, why you're talkin'
(Shut your mouth bitch)
I'm the shit, and you know, it
Never stops, there's no stoppin'
(It don't stop niggas)
Ridin' low, blowin' smoke, oh
As I cruise, the streets of Compton
(Roll out the '6-4), ('6-trey)
(Glasshouse), ('5-7 Chevrolet)
(And tell them niggas)
I'll let the whole world know that I can't be stopped
Even without Doc I'm still from the (Streets of Compton)
Yeah nigga I said it, and I'ma stay on top
Like a hoodrat with bomb ass cop
Run up on 'em like these rap niggas, I ain't gotta clap niggas
End your career with one line, like that nigga
Hit the switch (front and back), make it bounce (let it jump)
Killaforn-I-A is where I'm from
Three-wheelin' with the ass out
Smoke chronic 'til I pass out
Holdin' weight at my nigga Daz house
He always got a thick bad bitch from Long Beach
She a known freak and she got a long reach
She gon' touch it, suck it, fuck it
Never back down, especially when Al Green in the background
Now bitch, hit the weed and turn that ass 'round
It's time to bring back "Chronic" and the "Doggystyle"
West Coast niggas still holdin' shit down
I'm a G, you can't see, me
That must be, why you're talkin'
(Shut your mouth bitch)
I'm the shit, and you know, it
Never stops, there's no stoppin'
(It don't stop nigga)
Ridin' low, blowin' smoke, oh
As I cruise, the streets of Compton
(Roll out the '6-4), ('6-trey)
(Glasshouse), ('5-7 Chevrolet)
(And tell them niggas)
I'm back on the cover of The Source and the XXL
Floatin' all through the (Streets of Compton)
I got more bitches, more plaques
More beef and more straps
That's what the fuck I call gangsta rap
I was the Aftermath remedy 'til friends turned enemies
Streets kept me laced like blunts dipped in Hennessy
You niggas act like The Game can't roll 'em out
One man show, still sell a motherfucker out
With no Dre still sell the motherfucker out
'Cause everybody here from the (Streets of Compton)
We got Crip niggas, Blood niggas, ese's, Asians
Red and blue laces, tattoos on faces
I kept you niggas waitin', had to take you back to the basics
Switch the Impala from gold to chrome Dayton's
Everytime your bitch hear my voice she masturbatin'
I run through hoes like Walter Payton, on the daily
I got your main bitch swallowin' my babies
I'm a G, you can't see, me
That must be, why you're talkin'
(Shut your mouth bitch)
I'm the shit, and you know, it
Never stops, there's no stoppin'
(It don't stop nigga)
Ridin' low, blowin' smoke, oh
As I cruise, the streets of Compton
(Roll out the '6-4), ('6-trey)
(Glasshouse), ('5-7 Chevrolet)
(And tell them niggas)
I'm the West Coast Rakim, got you niggas blocked in
Glasshouse parked sideways on the stock rims
New-school, old-school mentality
Translation fours pumps and twelve batteries
Hydraulics make the world go round, your girl go down
Chronic make your girl slow down
Before she end up like Superhead (uh), givin' super head (uh)
Every nigga in the industry done fucked Super Head
(Shit) And I just might fuck her too
If I ever catch her slidin' or ridin' through the (Streets of Compton)
Rollin' down Green Leaf, smokin' on that green leaf
With a Mack 10 like was born on Queens St
Murder MC's like I was born in Queensbridge
That's how I show you pa niggas what a king is
And you don't wanna play chess on a time clock
I'm in the Hall of Fame, next to Snoop behind Pac
I got the whole motherfuckin' world locked
I'm a G, you can't see, me
That must be, why you're talkin'
(Shut your mouth bitch)
I'm the shit, and you know, it
Never stops, there's no stoppin'
(It don't stop nigga)
Ride the low, blowin' smoke, oh
As I cruise, the streets of Compton
(Roll out the '6-4), ('6-trey)
(Glasshouse), ('5-7 Chevrolet)
(And tell them niggas)
Everybody wanna know what the fuck is goin' on
Am I signed to Aftermath, Interscope
What's up with Geffen
I'ma just say it like this
One day I walked in the motherfuckin' house
And all my shit was gone
[Intro]
My mama took me to Sam Goody's
I wanted to buy a 50 Cent CD
I took that shit home
That shit was wack like a motherfucker
Don't fuck with Game
I like 50 Cent
He reminds me Spongebob
And Tony Yayo is Blues Clues
And Lloyd Banks is Dora the Explorer
They're my friends
Psyche
I went down one of them Bodaga shits right there in Harlem
Got me a bootleg Lloyd Banks and Young Buck CD
Took that shit home, put it in my boom box
Thought I was bout to be on some radio Raheim shit
Man that shit sound like some Vanessa Williams '88
I mean Olivia cute but they say that bitch a man
So this Black Wallstreet for life now
GGG-UNOT!
[The Game]
300 Bars and Runnin
Just loan me your ears for 15 minutes
Walk with me
Here the breakdown, pass the doja, .45 in the holster
Hollow tips'll fold 'em, them niggaz they toy soldiers
Oh, that boy colder than Hova unless he sober
Like I'm the president, but this ain't the takeover
Now, there's the speaker, bring your ears a little closer
Before you call this a diss, and you make Hova pissed
Why would I wanna do that? When I'm just the new cat
That was taught if a nigga take shots to shoot back
Defending his yard, yeah standing his ground
I'm saying if you gonna retire, then hand me the crown
Nah, let Bleek do it, then throw him a concert in Madison square
Watch everybody sleep through it
We can go bar for bar, I'll let the lines speak to 'em
What they say? Bleek is over let Chris and Neef do it
They say the wrong thing, I'ma smack 'em silly
What you thought? Them was the only niggaz that rapped in Philly?
See them niggaz with the soonies leave you wrapped in Philly
Then dash in groups like Beanie Mac in Philly
?? said Curtis Jack in Philly
Make a U-turn, I gotta go back to Philly
I forgot my cheese stake, that's what I told the cops
So they wouldn't get the dogs start searching for the glock
And I can't forget, B.I.G. got murdered by the cops
Even I was Ready To Die, when I heard that he was shot
What's beef? Beef is when I murk you on the spot
Labels signing many things, still searching for they Pac
I put purple on the block
So I don't feel threatened when Ludacris say he coming for the #1 spot
Ask 50, it get lonely on top
You can hate me or love me, but now the cops the only homies he got
When it's beef we eat, we win, but we ain't lonely we pop
You sell records but a GGG-u not!
Acting big on the radio, to me you not
You can ask Mr. CCC who hot
Tony Yayo I bet 10 G's you flop
Run up on that new 300 C you got
Stop hoping I fall, hope the bleeding stop
And I hope you black out before you see the cops
I ain't hot top for colors, I'm from Cedar Block
So I got my hot tops that make your breathing stop
I'm a gangsta slash rapper, check your CD shop
I'm like Elvis in there, they can't believe you dropped
Now I'm moving on up to George and Weezy's spot
I picked up where my homeboy Eazy stopped
I saw the west coast, put the shit on my back
Sprayed Aftermath on it, then loosened the strap
It get hot in here, let Lucifer rap
Bring hell to niggaz when Dre producing a track
Take it to the streets, put the duece duece to your hat
Then call up the pigs, tell them the rooster's back
Call Jadakiss, tell him that duke is back
I'm still by your side, no matter who comes strapped
Fuck Lloyd Banks, it ain't about who can rap
It's about when the ?? clap, is rufus back
I see what you thinkin, you want me to die, is that so?
Now you left leaning back, thanks to Fat Joe
We got reservations in heaven, you ready? Let's go
Drop them off, then the sound like Esko
I'm a say ?? if me and Dre talk
All Nas said back was he had a ??
Now that's the eulogy, beef is kinda foolish see
Niggaz running their mouth about what the fuck they gon' do to me
But quit the yapping before I proceed to clapping
And you gon' see the captain with plans of getting me captured
Even behind bars, I'm still gon' shine
I'm 10 years younger than Yayo, I get out, I'm fine
Then I go right back, nigga I pop mines
How you gon' drop Olivia, you only drop dimes
I knew you changed, when you started sleeping in that vest dog
I don't need 50 Cent, my niggaz make collect calls
1-800-split a faggot nigga wig
He got G-Unit wings, throw them off the Queens Bridge
Now your career is over, career is over
We in QB, banging CNN in the rover
T-O-N-Y, that's the phony NORE
You ain't the talk of New York, your sixteens is boring
Take that shit off ??, go back to PC
And tell 50 Cent you want a copy of Beef 3
I'm airing their ass out on DVD
You wanna rhyme like Lloyd Banks repeat after me
I'm a G-Unit toy soldier
On Sesame street doing voice overs
Bitch ass nigga need a rhyme dictionary, to rehearse his lines
Sound like Oscar the Grouch, with them nursery rhymes
We was in the studio, when I first got signed
He got stuck, he called 50 tryna borrow some lines
That's the wrong nigga, when you need help with your rhymes
All he gon' tell you is say G-Unit one more time
Got mad 'cause I ain't wanna make your beef mine
You got lucky with Ja, why you ain't go at Shyne?
He freestyled from the pen, that's just the fact
Said he'd put you with your mom, and you ain't fucked with that
Then you lied about your pops, he ain't never bust no cap
Like Father, Like Son, go ask Busta that
I knew from the beginning I couldn't trust those cats
I'd kill 'em all, if I could bring Justo back
The underground is mine, I treat it like home
It's the reason niggaz saying my name like Mike Jones
The underground is mine, I treat it like home
It's the reason niggaz saying my name like Mike Jones
The underground is mine, I treat it like home
It's the reason niggaz saying my name like Mike Jones
I said
The underground is mine, I treat it like home
It's the reason niggaz saying my name like Mike Jones
And I'm far from Houston but you can chop it and screw it
Do whatever to it, but it in the store the shit moving
Gave 'em a hundred bars, they ain't think I could do it
Came with two hundred, nigga this is more than music
Even Dre knew it, that boy hot like summer
Both ?? in the dirt, 300 Bars and Runnin
And I beef with any nigga, say my name motherfuck I'm gunnin'
You can put it on skee if you want it
I'll air you out on Drama King, Mike, or Clue
And watch them shits sell out like a Air Jordon shoe
I told Funk Flex when I catch the nigga Whoo Kid
We gon' see if he know how to DJ with bruised ribs
Don't hit me on the sidekick asking what you did
Get a gun or ask 50's police to use his
'cause Bloods gonna get ya
Bloods, Bloods gonna get ya for that Shadyville chain
That 380 spill brains, when I pop shots
Outside NY, in front of hip-hop cops
Or broad day in L.A., I'ma tell Em and Dre
This nigga bootlegging my music, ain't nothing for him to say
Took me off my own songs, then put it on his tapes
So I'ma take him out his house, put the beam on his face
Drop him off at Terror Squad, let him scream for the jakes
'cause when you fucking with Jayceon, you can bleed in the lake
For caking off niggaz on them CD's and tapes
Ask them to scratch a record, you will see he fake
If 50 was Puffy, you'd run and go get him a cheese cake
Take the DJ off your name, Mr. Instant replay
Not the instant replay
I mean the machine that G-Unit use every time 50 on stage singing like
Bitches only for your shit just a lil bit
Niggaz only for your shit just a lil bit
On my album 50 helped me just a lil bit
Only on two songs, now back to some killer shit
My clips bananas, I kill a gorilla quick
Beating on your chest, I see to your death, yep
Tell Ecko to make him a suit
Tell Reebock to make him some boots
Get him a head band, to cover the holes in his head
He a dead man for thinking he can walk through muddy waters like Redman
Banks blacked out and let the gun blam without a M-E-T-H-O-D Man
So the lieutenant gotta ask for his strings
Take my advice, never wear air max for the ??
Unless you one of the Bloods, or a latin king
'cause if your left with the Aryans your ass will sting
And your cell mate is a 25 to lifer
They will stab you then ?? then fuck you on Rikers
And Life Goes On
Now back to the coward of the hour who lied and said he write my songs
He told Vibe Dre was gonna leave me on the shelf
So he gave me all his hits, you should've kept them for yourself
Nigga stop acting tough before I stand over you
Show you how The Documentary live on top of The Massacre
Make a move I'm blasting your ass to the last one
Ten shots from the Mack empty the rest in the passenger
Fase yelling thats enough, let the coroner bag him up
Throw in Makaveli and lift the doors on the Maganum
Gun smoking, Fase think I'm locin' backing up
Reverse the '05 hurse on 41st and traffic, what
Hip-Hop cops on my left, but I pass 'em up
The Dodge got a hemmy in it, Game got a Remy in 'em
In and out of lanes like a New York cab
I'm Mr. Ol' King, that New York cab
Who's this fake nigga, on pictures with the Jake nigga?
Got his crew starving 'cause he ain't the whole cake, nigga
He ain't Nas, ain't B.I.G., ain't Jigga
If he ain't Cube or Pac then who you got?
We getting tired of you talkin about who you shot
I'll use another six bars to tell you who you not
You ain't 50 Cent, he went out like a gangsta
You went out with Vivica, three months after wanksta
Get Rich or Die Tryin, we thought you was hot
Now the same nigga wanna take us to the Candy Shop
C'mon man, what happened to the thug?
Now you could find in the club, him and Lloyd Banks hugging
Nigga got mad when The Game start buzzing
So fuck making friends now I'm into throwing slugs
Olivia talking about we a family, Game had to go
Nigga I'll smack that ho like I'm Jackie-O
'cause I don't wanna be cool, I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna shake hands, or wear your G-Unit shoes
Don't want you on my hooks, don't wanna be in your group
Just wanna sit here and wait
To be gone, so I can head back to the block
Fresh white Nike airs and the matching socks fitted
Pull the brim low, if they don't get it
Bentley Coup on gold daytons, I was the first one with it
Four times platinum, I done been there and did it
Came in the game and shitted, then wiped my ass with it
They say the Lord givth, if Lord take it away
So I build a house on top of Hip-Hop, I'll wait for the day
Niggaz hating on me, they don't want Jayceon to play
And the DA waiting on Jayceon to make a mistake
So they can put me in the SWAT car and lock me away
Give me a odd job in the pen for minimum pay
Let me out so I can drive down criminal way
Pushing the rock, nah this ain't no subliminal Jay
The summer too hot, and I want the winter to stay
'cause I'm a cold nigga when I put the pen to the page
Similar to them shells going into my gauge
I hand 'em off to Dre, he turned them into granades
And Just Blaze, 'cause the boy got game
Like I close my eyes, and woke up in a Roc chain
Now back to reality, my gun and my vest
And if diamonds are forever, then I'm Kanye West
Take a look at my chest, a hundred thou wet jacob
Whole crew got chains, a hundred thou can't break 'em
And the flow is hot like that wit Satan
And the only thing I got spinning is Daytons
The hotter I get the more willing to snake 'em
So soon as the beat drop, watch where I take 'em
Compton Swap meet, to get me some All-Stars
When Game in the house, they call ??
'cause they heard about what went on in D.C
Heard about Hot 97, my beef with 50
Now tell me do he got a conscience?
I think not, 'cause if he did I wouldn't be involved in this nonsense
Wouldn't be in Harlem, wouldn't be at this conference
I'd rather be pushing rock, like ??
50 whispered in my ear, like we still bonding
We ain't friends, I'm just acting like Charles Bronson
Middle finger in the air, one hand on my Johnson
Hip-Hop police on me like I'm the convict
What happened to the old school? I thought it was rhyming
Doug E. Fresh and Dana Day on the corner like Common
Now that ain't common, it's more like Top Ramen
The flow is news, I throw it up like vomit
And I still shine like diamonds
They kicked me out of G-Unit and I rebounded like Rodman
It's still Aftermath, two feet in the pentition
I be mad, I ain't, I'm supposed to stop I can't because
I'm in the hood politican, Impala ??
And I keep a black .45 on the side of my prada denim
Chip on my shoulder like I'm fresh outta prison
Dollar vision, blow a hundred thou like my wallet missing
Then re-up like kid before the d-cup
Continuously getting money with my feet up
Chasing the throne, here my black Air Force
I said fuck Benzino and got the cover of The Source
Feel me? If not then I guess you gotta kill me
But you ain't gon' do that so motherfucker move back
While I do B.I.G. and 'Pac impersonations on two tracks
When I wake the dead, everybody remove hats
We miss y'all, can I get a hand clap?
Now back to rap, why I gotta stay strapped?
On that murder T-I-P, kill you ASAP
They won't know which hole to patch up, when the ?? clap
I tried to spare you Young Buck, now it's time for payback
It go, how you from Cashville but you ain't got no cash nigga?
Say my name now that's your fucking ass nigga
Kept your mouth shut and I gave you a pass nigga
Now I gotta lay you down like the last nigga
Buck, buck, buck from my AK-47
This nigga playing with his life, I might have to put him in heaven
Tryna play the game, talking shit up on the stereo
Prepare for burial, it's when I'm reincarnating Harry-O
And you don't want that David 'cause you love your life
Get my Vibe, when it's war he pull out butter knifes
Muthafucker I'ma show you who the gangsta
All you do is Murder Inc., now who the wanksta?
When Suge had you, you were stranded on Tha Row
Juve left you for dead and went back to the NO
50 heard you on the tour bus and felt your little flow
Then he made you temporary replacement for Yayo
You a bitch, and that's hard to swallow
And you got robbed for your spinning G-Unit chain in Chicago
I call my nigga Jojo to get it back
He had the shit in his hands, and you ain't had the ten stacks
Picture that, I thought we was G-Unit
Then you ran and told 50 that I did that shit
Ask C-Murder, the boy ain't hard to find
I told Monica when I catch him The Boy is Mine
Take one shot of Brandy and pop
Watch his panties drop, when I run inside the Candy Shop
Fuck you, 50, Banks, Yayo, and the cops
And Olivia, I mean for a man she hot
Now I'm running out of breath, like I just beat boxed
Got 20 bars to go, lay it down like sheet rock
Don't worry about the flow, the boy know he hot
Hurricanes in store November, nigga fuck Reebocks
I'm fly like a Hummingbird on a tree top
The new Hov, the new B.I.G., the new 'Pac, I need three spots
280 in, ain't no getting me back
I'm yelling fuck the world, on my victory lap
Remember first it was Buddens, then it was Bleek
Now it's whoever motherfucker, yeah, who want beef?
Now whenever motherfucker, who wanna see me?
In the coffin, body exhausted, resting in peace
You don't want war nigga, you want peace
So give 'em the peace, capiche (sp?)
Let 'em rest in peace
From west to east the flow is outdatable, irreplacable
Lyrical homicide, hell is hot, I'm boxing with Satan
And I slipped 'em the ace, you cannot replace 'em
If Eazy ever decide to return, I remain Jayceon
A king in the making, and the throne is for the taking
So I climb the mountain top and put my stake in
Got the weight of the world on my shoulder
Not a nigga nor a hoodrat bitch can stop me from taking it over
This is crack music, go get the baking soda
300 Bars and Runnin, nigga the wait is over
I'm gone...
[Jamie Foxx]
Oh yeah
[Chorus: Jamie Foxx]
I know you're sick and tired of waitin' on me girl
But I'm, just tryin' to get my money right
So let some dumb nigga take a flight
So I can take you all around the world
Planes, trains, automobiles
Bentley or a Range, chromed-out wheels
First class ticket, G-4, you that deal
For real (I can take you all around the world)
[The Game]
She like black Bentley Coupes, black Day-tons
Black interior, black ridin' shotgun
Black four-five, black Air Ones
Bangin' "The Black Album," track #1
She like that Jay shit, that's her favorite
If it's gon' get me the pussy I'ma play that shit
If she bite too hard, I'ma say that shit
But don't bite me bitch, I don't play that shit
Marques Houston, I don't play that shit
By the time we got halfway through watchin' "Ray" I hit
I laid it down beat it up, let her go clean it up
Take a five minute nap, wake up and eat it, what
The it's part two, in the sauna
Feel like I'm fuckin' Mary J. cause she don't want, +No Drama+
I'd rather take yo' ass to the Bahamas
Then give you 30 thousand a month like Diddy baby mama
[Chorus]
[The Game]
Picture me thuggin', picture me lovin' you
Like Bobby love Whitney now picture me fuckin'
Pullin' your ponytail smackin' you on the ass
Tellin' you how (I can take you all around the world)
That nigga can't do it like this
Even Beyonce couldn't move it like this
She only fuck with +Soldiers+, that's her shit
I hate to admit it but I love my bitch
So much, I'm sittin' outside in the Benz
Thinkin' back to Dre's house when I fucked her best friend
The pussy wasn't nothin', now I'm dealin'
With "The Diary of a Mad Black Woman" with Louis Vuitton luggage
She told me she was tired of The Game and rap
Quit like Ma$e then she came right back
I told you the bitch sex was wack
And you're all I need, even Jamie know that
[Chorus]
[The Game]
You know what they say, more money more problems more drama
Means more marijuana and less baby mama
You know I love you like I love my shoes
But even white Air Force Ones come in twos
Yeah, I like her, and I like you too
What's wrong? She my bitch and you my boo
She got a Range Rover Sport, you got a Bentley Coupe
She take my clothes to the cleaners, you take Harlem to school
I gave you your Burkin' bags, so I made a mistake
And Oprah don't fuck with them no more anyway
I'm sorry for the bullshit I put you through
But I ain't goin' nowhere, I got a kid wit'chu
Why we always gotta argue about Superheads book?
She sucked my dick with a condom on, after that I shook
And when she start talkin' 'bout buyin' a ring
I just turn the volume up and let Jamie Foxx sing
[Chorus]
[Jamie Foxx]
Around the world with me yeah
Around the world with me, hey
Around the world with me, hey
Mmm, oh
Yeah, let's take 'em back
Uh huh
Comin' up I was confused, my mama kissin' a girl
Confusin' occurs, comin' up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committin' felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing ch-check out my melody
I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope
Four-four fingering, one of them gold ropes
Nanna told me if I pass I'll get a sheep skin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'll be dope
Tossed and turn in my sleep that night
Woke up the next mornin' niggas done stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothin' good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could
Hate it or love, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me
Hate it or love, the underdog's ontop
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me
I told Dre from the gate, I carry the heat fo' ya
First mixtape song, I inherited beef fo' ya
Gritted my teeth fo' ya, G-G-G'd fo ya (G-Unit)
Put Compton on my back when you was in need of soldiers
At my last show, I threw away my NWA gold
And had the whole crowd yellin' free Yayo
So niggas better get up outta mine
Before I creep and turn ya projects into Columbine
And I'm rap's MVP
Don't make me remind y'all what happened in D.C.
This nigga ain't Gotti, he pretend
Mad at us, cause Ashanti's got a new boyfriend
And it seems your little rat turned out to be a mouse
This beef shit is for the birds and the birds fly south
Even Young Buck can vouch, when the doubts was out
Who gave the West Coast mouth to mouth
Hate it or love, the underdog's ontop
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me
Hate it or love, the underdog's ontop
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me
From the beginnin' to the end
Losers lose, winners win
This is real, we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in
Is full of pressure and pain
I thought it would change
Its stayin' the same
How many hidden bowls is with'cha ya
When you had that little TV you had to hit on to get a picture
I'm walkin' with the snub, cause niggaz do a lotta slick talkin' in the club
Till they coughin' on the rug, ain't never had much but a walkman and a bud
My role model is gone, snortin' up his drug, bad enough they want me to choke
My boy just got poked in the throat, now its a R.I.P. shirt in my coat
Now I'm speedin' reminiscin', holdin' my weed hit never listen
If I see him then I'ma lift'em and maybe that'll even the score
And if not, then it'll be me on the floor
Hate it or love, the underdog's ontop
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me
Hate it or love, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me
I started out at fifteen, scared as hell
I took thirty off a pack and I made them sell
As a youth, man I used to hustle for loot
With that little deuce deuce and my triple fat goose
Sippin' easy Jesus rockin' the leases
My mama whipped me when she found my pieces
I look back on life and think God I bless
We the best on the planet so forget the rest
You know I'm still nice with my cook game
Look man, its a hood thing that's why I'm loved in Brooklyn
I handle mine just like a real nigga should
If I do some time, homie I'm still all good
Let me show what a thug bout born to die
I took the bullets outta 50, put 'em in my four five
And I ain't even got my feet wet yet
A seven figure nigga who ain't seen a royalty check
Hate it or love, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me
Hate it or love, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me
Walking down the street, in my All Stars
In my, khaki suit, doin what I do
Walking down the street, smoking, chronic
In my black locs, lookin, at you
Guess who's back on the West coast tracks
It's the motherfucking messiah of gangsta rap
Still dip in the six-fo', still puffin on the same chronic
Haters mad cause I still got it
I never fall off, even without the Doc
You niggas sellin your soul trying to stay on top
Bitch nigga check your Kotex
You niggas ain't moving shit like the hand on a fake-ass Rolex
I'm five million sold
The cover of my last album the only time you see me sittin on gold
I'm the most anticipated, most celebrated
Most loved and the motherfucking most hated
Keep rolling like gold Daytons
Niggas got the game fucked up like Hennessy with a Coke chaser
You gotta deal with me, I'm the West Coast savior
Niggas think of me every time they six-fo' scraper
What do you call a nigga who's overbearing
Belligerent, foul, defiant and very disrespectful?
You call that nigga the Doctor's Advocate
He's a reflection of Dr. Dre in his heyday in the worst way
The five star surgeon general
Took Jayceon to the Aftermath research department
And gave him a blood test
It came back G-A-M-E positive
The nigga's infected with the Game virus
His oratorical skills are so impeccable
That niggas in the streets call him Cyrus
The young damu's down with violence
Cause in his heart he's a tyrant
It's not a game, it's just called The Game
There'll be no referees, no halftime reports
When the game is over, The Game is over
You can't put a quarter in the machine and get three mo' men
THAT'S, the end
Walking down the street, in my All Stars
In my, khaki suit, doin what I do
Walking down the street, smoking, chronic
In my black locs, lookin, at you
I done been to hell and back
Left for dead, you know who to thank for that
Finished my second LP without a Dr. Dre track
You can take my soul but can't take my plaques
I'm the motherfucking snare when it touch the beat
I'm the 808 drum that got you movin your feet
I'm the heir to the throne after the D-R-E
Product of my environment, you old-ass niggas
Get ready for your early retirement
Before I let hip-hop burn down I run in the building like a fireman
Who can outspit me when I'm high off sticky
Throwing back Patron shots in some creased up dickies
I'm D.O.C. certified, Ice Cube lynch'd me
Snoop stamped me and the good Doc handpicked me
You still with me?
Me and my mic can't be separated like Interscope and hahaha
Ohh shit
This some good ass motherfucking weed
California sticky green!
This is the aftermath for the Aftermath
West, coast!
Remember me? Like father, like son
Had a million dollars 'fore I was 1
'Cause my daddy hustle
We good now
'Cause my daddy hustle
We out the hood now
'Cause my daddy hustle
Remember me? Like father, like son
Had a million dollars 'fore I was 1
'Cause my daddy hustle
We good now
'Cause my daddy hustle
We out the hood now
'Cause my daddy hustle
Winning like Steph Curry in the chip though
Used to be the only one, now I'm the big bro (I'm here too)
Know my daddy schizo, don't mess with his kids yo
Me and my brother tight (yeah), we like the Klitschkos
I love you daddy
Ten years later, I love you too sons
I do life in the box if they ever fuck with my two sons
You're my lil' man, I remember the first day you came out
Your lil' face, your big nose, your lil' feet, your lil' hands
You turned one, come in the room wobbly, lil' stance
And every time I walked in the house he used to do this lil' dance
On the cover of the album with them Chucks on
You cried for 6 hours, your mama in here going nuts on me
She said you had enough, I said we having fun
All babies cry when they're one, my career had just begun
And so did being a daddy
Car seat in my Escalade, you want me in the Caddy
Playing Like Father, Like Son, looking in the back seat
He don't look nothing like his mama if you ask me
On the first album Busta Rhymes did the hook
Now he can do it for himself, watch him and his uncle cook
Buss
I'm glad you grew up to becoming everything you could be
That's all I wanted for you young'n, like father, like son
And in the end I'm glad you only turned out better than me
I hope you know I love you young'n, like father, like son
Your daddy told you it was coming
Coming, your day was coming, I told you
Now daddy's here just keep on running
Running, just keep on running, I tell you
I wanna thank my baby mamas Tiff and Eliska for everything
Y'all deserve the world, I wasn't worthy of no wedding ring
It ain't be one day since I met you I wasn't there for you
Wasn't husband material, but you know I really cared for you
And I know you remember that time when he was 5
All these tours taking the toll, I can see it in his eyes
So I stopped tours, stopped rapping, didn't give a fuck about
Nothing that happened after recording The Doctor's Advocate
Catching up with my son, cause ain't nothing more important
Than walking inside the Footlocker, copping them matching Jordans
Helping him with his jumper, the day he turned 9
I asked him what he want for his birthday, he said to spend some time
So we kick it, that's my best friend, I don't have to get married
He still my best man, and that's forever
Anybody can be a daddy, just bust a nut and leave
But I'm a father, and I'ma be everything he need and more
I'm glad you grew up to becoming everything you could be
That's all I wanted for you young'n, like father, like son
And in the end I'm glad you only turned out better than me
I hope you know I love you young'n, like father, like son
Your daddy told you it was coming
Coming, your day was coming, I told you
Now daddy's here just keep on running
Running, just keep on running, I tell you
Every time I get in this booth
I'm reminded ten years ago I did it for you, had this vision for you
And I know your daddy get in trouble sometimes
But I'ma stay up out this prison for you, I mean
You all my seed, lil' brother and both of your sisters
You all I need like Method and MJB
And I know I be wildin' sometimes, you told me ("Breathe daddy") (1,1, 2,2, 3,3, 4,4)
Furthermore, I'm try'na stay outta trouble just for my sons
Even though it feel weird leaving my house without a gun
I just gotta do it, cause they might grow up and do this shit
Just cause they father do it, fuck with my kids and six Bloods
Jumping out a Buick, understand Puff choking that man for Jus
I'ma do my stuff even if I land in fucking cuffs
For every nigga out here without a kid
Have one and that's gon be the best shit you ever did
One
Pull the rag off the six-fo'
Hit the switch, show niggas how the shit go
The Game is back, the Aftermath chain is gone
The D's is chrome, the frame is black
(So watch it lift up)
Till the motherfucker bounce and break
And knock both of the screws out the licence plate
Let the games begin
These other rap niggas so far behind me, go taste my rims
Shit, let the chronic burn as the Daytons spin
It ain't been this much drama since I first heard Eminem
In the club, poppin' X pills like M & Ms
Call it Dre day, we celebratin', bitch bring a friend
Bottles on me, tell the waiter to order another round
And put that cheap-ass hypnotic down
(Put your 'cris up!)
If you feel the same way
Who got 'em hittin' switches NY to LA
(If I could fit the whole hood in the club)
Hop in the low-rider, long as you got bitches in the back
(I turn it into a strip-club)
Call it a lap-dance, when the six-fo' bounce that ass
(If I could fit the hole world in the club)
Tell the DJ to bang my shit, the west-coast in this bitch
(Pop bottles and twist up)
Roll up chronic and hash
In a blunt, call it Aftermath
Somebody tell me where the drinks at
Where the bitches at
You fucking on the first night, meet me in the back
I got a pound of chronic, and a gang of freaks
Move bitch! Who the fuck you think they came to see?
The protÃ©gÃ© of the D R E
You take a picture with him, and you gotta fuck me
And you gotta fuck Busta, can't touch Eve
Got something in my waist that you can't touch either
That's â my gangsta bitch, and like Crips and Bloods
I'm in the club on some gangsta shit
(So nigga twist up)
Light another dub
Bitches get scared when niggas start fighting in the club
Ain't nothing but a g-thing, baby it's a g-thing
Bounce like you got hydraulics in your g-string
I fuck a different bitch seven days a week
Hit the switch, watch it bounce like a Scott Storch beat
(If I could fit the whole hood in the club)
Hop in the low-rider, long as you got bitches in the back
(I turn it into a strip-club)
Call it a lap-dance, when the six-fo' bounce that ass
(If I could fit the hole world in the club)
Tell the DJ to bang my shit, the west-coast in this bitch
(Pop bottles and twist up)
Roll up chronic and hash
In a blunt, call it Aftermath
Niggas thought I wasn't coming back, look at me now
Hoppin' out the same Cherry six-fo' with the motherfucking top down
I'm The Game, nigga
Call your bitch, she ain't home, she with Game, nigga
Remember that, Dre
You passed me the torch, I lit the chronic with it, now the world is my ashtray
Ridin' three-wheel motion 'till the ass scrapes
Turn sunset into a motherfucking drag-race
Now watch it bounce
Hit the switch, let it bounce till the police shut the shit down
(When you hit the club)
Tell 'em you came with me
(We gonna twist up)
In the V.I.P
It's a new day, and if you ever knew Dre
Motherfucker, you would say I was the new Dre
Same Impala, different spokes
Same chronic, just a different smoke
(If I could fit the whole hood in the club)
Hop in the low-rider, long as you got bitches in the back
(I turn it into a strip-club)
Call it a lap-dance, when the six-fo' bounce that ass
(If I could fit the hole world in the club)
Tell the DJ to bang my shit, the west-coast in this bitch
(Pop bottles and twist up)
Roll up chronic and hash
In a blunt, call it Aftermath
This is how we do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This is how we do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love
This is how we do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This is how we do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love
Fresh like, Impala,
Chrome hydraulics, 808 drums
You don't want, none
Nigga better, run
When beef is on, I'll pop that, drum
Come get, some
Pistol grip, pump
If a nigga step on my white Air, Ones
Since red, rum
Ready here I, come
Compton,
Dre found me in the, slums
Sellin' that skunk, one hand on my gun
I was sellin' rocks when Master P was sayin "Unnnh"
Buck pass the blunt
These G-Unit girls just want to have, fun
Coke and rum
Got weed on the ton
I'm bangin' with my hand up her dress like,
I'll make her cum, purple haze in my lungs
Whole gang in the front in case a nigga want to, stunt
I put Lamborghini doors on that Es-co-lade
Lil pro so look like I'm riding on blades
In one year man, a nigga's so paid
I have a straight bitch in the telly goin' both ways (Ah!)
Touch me, tease me, kiss me, please me
I give it to ya just how you like it, girl
You know I'm rockin' with the best tre pound on my hip
Teflon on my chest
They say I'm no good
Cause I'm so hood
Rich folks do not want me around
Cause shit might pop off, and if shit pop off
Somebody gon' get laid the fuck out
They call me new money, say I have no class
I'm from the bottom, I came up too fast
The hell if I care, I'm just here to get my cash
Bougie ass bitches, you can kiss my ass
This is how we do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This is how we do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love
This is how we do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This is how we do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love
I put gold Daytonas on that Cherry Six-Four
White walls so clean it's like I'm ridin on bulbs
Hit one switch mang, that ass so low
Cali got niggaz in New York ridin on hundred spokes
Touch me, tease me, kiss me, please me
I give it to ya just how you like it, girl
You now rockin with the best fo' pound on my hip
Gold chain on my chest (Ah!)

We wrap up ya punk ass, stunt 'n ya done
Homie, it's Game time
You ready? Here I come
Call Lloyd Banks and get this motherfucker, crunk
It took two, months
But Fifty got it done
Signed with G-unit
Had niggas like, "huh?"
Don't try to front

Thinkin' I'm a punk
Get your fuckin' head, lumped
Fifty got a, gun
Ready here he come
Gotta sick, vendetta
To get this, chedda'
Meet my Ba, Retta'
The dra-ma, setta'
Sip Am-a, retta'
My flow sounds, better

On tracks I'm a savage
I damage
Any nigga tryin' to front on my clique (G-Unit!)

[INTRO]
My mama took me to Sam Goody's
I wanted to buy a 50 Cent CD
I took that shit home
That shit was wack like a muthafucka
Don't fuck with Game
I like 50 Cent
He reminds me Spongebob
And Tony Yayo is Blues Clues
And Lloyd Banks is Dora the Explorer
They're my friends
Psyche
I went down one of them Bodaga shits right there in Harlem
Got me a bootleg Lloyd Banks and Young Buck CD
Took that shit home, put it in my boom box
Thought I was bout to be on some radio Raheim shit
Man that shit sound like some Vanessa Williams '88
I mean Olivia cute but they say that bitch a man
So this Black Wallstreet for life now
GGG-UNOT!
[GAME]
300 Bars and Runnin
Just loan me your ears for 15 minutes
Walk with me
Here the breakdown, pass the doja, .45 in the holster
Hollow tips'll fold 'em, them *****z they toy soldiers
Oh, that boy colder than Hova unless he sober
Like I'm the president, but this ain't the takeover
Now, there's the speaker, bring your ears a little closer
Before you call this a diss, and you make Hova pissed
Why would I wanna do that? When I'm just the new cat
That was taught if a ***** take shots to shoot back
Defending his yard, yeah standing his ground
I'm saying if you gonna retire, then hand me the crown
Nah, let Bleek do it, then throw him a concert in Madison square
Watch everybody sleep through it
We can go bar for bar, I'll let the lines speak to 'em
What they say? Bleek is over let Chris and Neef do it
They say the wrong thing, I'ma smack 'em silly
What you thought? Them was the only *****z that rapped in Philly?
See them *****z with the soonies leave you wrapped in Philly
Then dash in groups like Beanie Mac in Philly
?? said Curtis Jack in Philly
Make a U-turn, I gotta go back to Philly
I forgot my cheese stake, that's what I told the cops
So they wouldn't get the dogs start searching for the glock
And I can't forget, B.I.G. got murdered by the cops
Even I was Ready To Die, when I heard that he was shot
What's beef? Beef is when I murk you on the spot
Labels signing many things, still searching for they Pac
I put purple on the block
So I don't feel threatened when Ludacris say he coming for the #1 spot
Ask 50, it get lonely on top
You can hate me or love me, but now the cops the only homies he got
When it's beef we eat, we win, but we ain't lonely we pop
You sell records but a GGG-u not!
Acting big on the radio, to me you not
You can ask Mr. CCC who hot
Tony Yayo I bet 10 G's you flop
Run up on that new 300 C you got
Stop hoping I fall, hope the bleeding stop
And I hope you black out before you see the cops
I ain't High Top from Colors, I'm from Cedar Block
What i got in my high tops will make your breathing stop
I'm a gangsta slash rapper, check your CD shop
I'm like Elvis in there, they can't believe he dropped
Now I'm moving on up to George and Weezy's spot
I picked up where my homeboy Eazy stopped
I saw the west coast, put the shit on my back
Sprayed Aftermath on it, then loosened the strap
It get hot in here, let Lucifer rap
Bring hell to *****z when Dre producing a track
Take it to the streets, put the duece duece to your hat
Then call up the pigs, tell them the rooster's back
Call Jadakiss, tell him that duke is back
I'm still by your side, no matter who comes strapped
Fuck Lloyd Banks, it ain't about who can rap
It's about when the ruger clap, is rufus back
I see what you thinkin, you want me to die, is that so?
Now you left leaning back, thanks to Fat Joe
You got reservations in heaven, you ready? Let's go
Drop them off, then pop cristal wit Esko
I'm a say he hit me first, if me and Dre talk
All Nas said back was he had a 3-4
Now that's the eulogy, beef is kinda foolish see
*****z running their mouth about what the fuck they gon' do to me
But quit the yapping before I proceed to clapping
And you gon' see the captain with plans of getting me captured
Even behind bars, I'm still gon' shine
I'm 10 years younger than Yayo, I get out, I'm fine
Then I go right back, ***** I pop mines
How you gon' drop Olivia, you only drop dimes
I knew you changed, when you started sleeping in that vest dog
I don't need 50 Cent, my *****z make collect calls
1-800-split a faggot ***** wig
He got G-Unit wings, throw them off the Queens Bridge
Now your career is over, career is over
We in QB, banging CNN in the rover
T-O-N-Y, that's the phony NORE
You ain't the talk of New York, your sixteens is boring
Take that shit off lingo, go back to PC
And tell 50 Cent you want a copy of Beef 3
I'm airing their ass out on DVD
You wanna rhyme like Lloyd Banks repeat after me
I'm a G-Unit toy soldier
On Sesame street doing voice overs
Bitch ass ***** need a rhyme dictionary, to rehearse his lines
Sound like Oscar the Grouch, with them nursery rhymes
We was in the studio, when I first got signed
He got stuck, he called 50 tryna borrow some lines
That's the wrong *****, when you need help with your rhymes
All he gon' tell you is say G-Unit one more time
Got mad 'cause I ain't wanna make your beef mine
You got lucky with Ja, why you aint go at Shyne?
He freestyled from the pen, that's just the fact
Said he'd put you with your mom, and you ain't fucked with that
Then you lied about your pops, he ain't never bust no cap
Like Father, Like Son, go ask Busta that
I knew from the beginning not to trust those cats
I'd kill 'em all, if I could bring Justo back
The underground is mine, I treat it like home
It's the reason *****z saying my name like Mike Jones
The underground is mine, I treat it like home
It's the reason *****z saying my name like Mike Jones
The underground is mine, I treat it like home
It's the reason *****z saying my name like Mike Jones
I said
The underground is mine, I treat it like home
It's the reason *****z saying my name like Mike Jones
And I'm far from Houston but you can chop it and screw it
Do whatever to it, but it in the store the shit moving
Gave 'em a hundred bars, they ain't think I could do it
Came with two hundred, ***** this is more than music
Even Dre knew it, that boy hot like summer
Both feet in the dirt, 300 Bars and Runnin
And I beef with any *****, say my name muthafuck I'm gunnin'
You can put it on skee if you want it
I'll air you out on Drama King, Mike, or Clue
And watch them shits sell out like a Air Jordon shoe
I told Funk Flex when I catch the ***** Whoo Kid
We gon' see if he know how to DJ with bruised ribs
Don't hit me on the sidekick asking what you did
Get a gun or ask 50's police to use his
'cause Bloods gonna get ya
Bloods Bloods Bloods gonna get ya for that Shadyville chain
That 380 spill brains, when I pop shots
Outside NY, in front of hip-hop cops
Or broad day in L.A., I'ma tell Em and Dre
This ***** bootlegging my music, ain't nothing for him to say
Took me off my own songs, then put it on his tapes
So I'ma take him out his house, put the beam on his face
Drop him off at Terror Squad, let him scream for the jakes
'cause when you fucking with Jayceon, you can believe in L.A.
For caking off *****z on them CD's and tapes
Ask them to scratch a record, you will see he fake
If 50 was Puffy, you'd run and go get him a cheese cake
Take the DJ off your name, Mr. Instant replay
Not the instant replay
I mean the machine that G-Unit use every time 50 on stage singing like
Bitches only feel your shit just a lil bit
*****z only feel your shit just a lil bit
On my album 50 helped me just a lil bit
Only on two songs, now back to some killa shit
My clips bananas, I kill a gorilla quick
Beating on your chest, I see to your death, yep
Tell Ecko to make him a suit
Tell Reebock to make him some boots
Get him a head band, to cover the holes in his head
He a dead man for thinking he can walk through muddy waters like Redman
Banks blacked out and let the gun blam without a M-E-T-H-O-D Man
So the lieutenant gotta ask for his strings
Take my advice, never wear air max for the pen
Unless you one of the Bloods, or a latin king
'cause if your left with the Aryans your ass will sting
And your cell mate is a 25 to lifer
They'll stab you at Folsom then fuck you on Rikers
And Life Goes On
Now back to the coward of the hour who lied and said he write my songs
He told Vibe Dre was gonna leave me on the shelf
So he gave me all his hits, you should've kept them for yourself
***** stop acting tough before I stand over you
Show you how The Documentary live on top of The Massacre
Make a move I'm blasting your ass to the last one
Ten shots from the Mack empty the rest in the passenger
Fase yelling thats enough, let the coroner bag him up
Throw in Makaveli and lift the doors on the Maganum
Gun smoking, Fase think I'm locin' backing up
Reverse the '05 hurse on 41st and traffic, what
Hip-Hop cops on my left, but I pass 'em up
The Dodge got a hemmy in it, Game got a Remy in 'em
In and out of lanes like a New York cab
I'm Mr. Ol' King, that New York cab
Who's this fake *****, on pictures with the Jake *****?
Got his crew starving 'cause he aint the whole cake, *****
He ain't Nas, ain't B.I.G., ain't Jigga
If he ain't Cube or Pac then who you got?
We getting tired of you talkin about who you shot
I'll use another six bars to tell you who you not
You ain't 50 Cent, he went out like a gangsta
You went out with Vivica, three months after wanksta
Get Rich or Die Tryin, we thought you was hot
Now the same ***** wanna take us to the Candy Shop
C'mon man, what happened to the thug?
Now you could find in the club, him and Lloyd Banks hugging
***** got mad when The Game start buzzing
So fuck making friends now I'm into throwing slugs
Olivia talking about we a family, Game had to go
***** I'll smack that ho like I'm Jackie-O
'cause I don't wanna be cool, I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna shake hands, or wear your G-Unit shoes
Don't want you on my hooks, don't wanna be in your group
Just wanna sit here and wait
To be gone, so I can head back to the block
Fresh white Nike airs and the matching socks fitted
Pull the brim low, if they don't get it
Bentley Coup on gold daytons, I was the first one with it
Four times platinum, I done been there and did it
Came in the game and shitted, then wiped my ass with it
They say the Lord givth, if Lord take it away
So I build a house on top of Hip-Hop, I'll wait for the day
*****z hating on me, they don't want Jayceon to play
And the DA waiting on Jayceon to make a mistake
So they can put me in the squad car and lock me away
Give me a odd job in the pen for minimum pay
Let me out so I can drive down criminal way
Pushing the rock, nah this ain't no subliminal Jay
The summer too hot, and I want the winter to stay
'cause I'm a cold ***** when I put the pen to the page
Similar to them shells going into my gauge
I hand 'em off to Dre, he turned them into granades
And Just Blaze, 'cause the boy got game
Like I close my eyes, and woke up in a Roc chain
Now back to reality, my gun and my vest
And if diamonds are forever, then I'm Kanye West
Take a look at my chest, a hundred thou at jacob
Whole crew got chains, a hundred thou can't break 'em
And the flow is hot like that wit Satan
And the only thing I got spinning is Daytons
The hotter I get the more willing to snake 'em
So soon as the beat drop, watch where I take 'em
Compton Swap meet, to get me some All-Stars
When Game in the house, they callin all cars
'cause they heard about what went on in D.C.
Heard about Hot 97, my beef with 50
Now tell me do he got a conscience?
I think not, 'cause if he did I wouldn't be involved in this nonsense
Wouldn't be in Harlem, wouldn't be at this conference
I'd rather be pushing rock, like Samantha Ronson
50 whispered in my ear, like we still bonding
We ain't friends, I'm just acting like Charles Bronson
Middle finger in the air, one hand on my Johnson
Hip-Hop police on me like I'm the convict
What happened to the old school? I thought it was rhyming
Doug E. Fresh and Daina Dane on the corner like Common
Now that ain't common, it's more like Top Ramen
The flow is noodles, I throw it up like vomit
And I still shine like diamonds
They kicked me out of G-Unit and I rebounded like Rodman
It's still Aftermath, two feet in the paint shit.
I be mad, I ain't, I'm supposed to stop I can't because
I'm in the hood politican, Impala liffin'
And I keep a black .45 on the side of my prada denim
Chip on my shoulder like I'm fresh outta prison
Dollar vision, blow a hundred thou like my wallet missing
Then re-up like kid before the d-cup
Continuously getting money with my feet up
Chasing the throne, here my black Air Force
I said fuck Benzino and got the cover of The Source
Feel me? If not then I guess you gotta kill me
But you ain't gon' do that so muthafucka move back
While I do B.I.G. and 'Pac impersonations on two tracks
When I wake the dead, everybody remove hats
We miss ya'll, can I get a hand clap?
Now back to rap, why I gotta stay strapped?
On that murder T-I-P, kill you ASAP
They won't know which hole to patch up, when the K clap
I tried to spare you Young Buck, now it's time for payback
It go, how you from Cashville but you ain't got no cash nigga?
Say my name now that's your fucking ass nigga
Kept your mouth shut and I gave you a pass nigga
Now I gotta lay you down like the last nigga
Buck, buck, buck from my AK-47
This nigga playing with his life, I might have to put him in heaven
Tryna play the game, talking shit up on the stereo
Prepare for burial, it's when I'm reincarnating Harry-O
And you don't want that David 'cause you love your life
Get my Vibe, when it's war he pull out butter knifes
Muthafucka I'ma show you who the gangsta
All you do is Murder Inc., now who the wanksta?
When Suge had you, you were stranded on Tha Row
Juve left you for dead and went back to the NO
50 heard you on the tour bus and felt your little flow
Then he made you temporary replacement for Yayo
You a bitch, and that's hard to swallow
And you got robbed for your spinning G-Unit chain in Chicago
I call my nigga Jojo to get it back
He had the shit in his hands, and you ain't had the ten stacks
Picture that, I thought we was G-Unit
Then you ran and told 50 that I did that shit
Ask C-Murder, the boy ain't hard to find
I told Monica when I catch him The Boy is Mine
Take one shot of Brandy and pop
Watch his panties drop, when I run inside the Candy Shop
Fuck you, 50, Banks, Yayo, and the cops
And Olivia, I mean for a man she hot
Now I'm running out of breath, like I just beat boxed
Got 20 bars to go, lay it down like sheet rock
Don't worry about the flow, the boy know he hot
Hurricanes in store November, nigga fuck Reebocks
I'm fly like a Hummingbird on a tree top
The new Hov, the new B.I.G., the new 'Pac, I need three spots
280 in, ain't no getting me back
I'm yelling fuck the world, on my victory lap
Remember first it was Buddens, then it was Bleek
Now it's whoever muthafucka, yeah, who want beef?
Now whenever muthafucka, who wanna see me?
In the coffin, body exhausted, resting in peace
You don't want war nigga, you want peace
So give 'em the peace, capiche (sp?)
Let 'em rest in peace
From west to east the flow is outdatable, irreplacable
Lyrical homicide, hell is hot, I'm boxing with Satan
And I slipped 'em the ace, you cannot replace 'em
If Eazy ever decide to return, I remain Jayceon
A king in the making, and the throne is for the taking
So I climb the mountain top and put my stake in
Got the weight of the world on my shoulder
Not a nigga nor a hoodrat bitch can stop me from taking it over
This is crack music, go get the baking soda
300 Bars and Runnin, nigga the wait is over
I'm gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone
Yo Dre, I thought I was dead
West coast
I'm the doctor's advocate
Nigga Dre shot ya
Brought me back from the dead
That's why they call him the doctor
The mavs gon' drop em
If 50 ain't rockin' wit him no more
It's ok, I get it poppin'
The whole club rockin' like da 6-4 Impala
Drink Cris throw it up call the shit hydraulics
Then piss in the cup call the shit Hipnotiq
I bleed Compton, spit crack, the shit chronic
And you new niggas ain't shit but new niggas
Baped n ape shoe niggas I'm talkin' to you nigga
Bounce in the 6-4 throwin' up west side man
Sell another five million albums, yes I am
Fresh like damn dis nigga did it again
A hundred thousand on his neck, LA above the brim
Inside the Lambo', shotgun wit Snoop
What would the muthafuckin' west coast be without
One crip and one blood?
One blood, one blood, one blood
Blood, blood, blood
One blood, one blood, one blood, one blood, one blood
I'm from the west side of the 6-4 Impala
When niggas say, Where you from?
We'll never say holla
Bandana on the right side, gun on the left side
Niggas in New York know how to throw up the west side
Word to Eazy, I'm so ill believe me
I made room for Jeezy
But the rest of you niggas better be glad you breathing
All I need is one reason
I'm the King and Dre said it the west coast need me
I don't know why you niggas keep tryin' me
Everybody know that I'm the heir to the Aftermath dynasty
And I ain't got to make shit for the club
What DJ gon' turn down the 38 snub?
You 38 and you still rappin'? Uhh
I'm 26 nigga, so is the dubs
On the 07 Hummer hop out
Nobody guards, when the chronic
Smoke clear, all you gon' see is one blood
One blood, one blood, one blood
Blood, blood, blood
One blood, one blood, one blood, one blood, one blood
I ain't got beef wit 50, no beef wit J
What's beef when you gettin' head in the 6 trey?
And the double game change, I keep em on display
Black t-shirt so all you see is the A
Turn on the TV and all you see is the A
You niggas better make up a dance and try to get radio play
Keep on snappin' your fingers, I ain't goin' away
I don't regret what I spit, cause I know what I say
And niggas talk about me, they don't know when to stop
I got the Louis Vuitton belt buckle holdin' the glock
No beam, no silencer, I know when to pop
I wait till Lil' Jon come on and let off a shot
I had the number one Billboard spot
Niggas stepped on my fingers and I climbed right back to the top
I'm BIG, I'm Cube, I'm Nas, I'm Pac
This ain't shit but a warning till my album drop
One blood, one blood, one blood, one blood
Blood, blood, blood
One blood, one blood, one blood, one blood, one blood
One blood, one blood, one blood, one blood
Blood, blood, blood
You got them funny ass colors on, take it off
If you in the club with ice on we takin' off
I thought you was a gangsta nigga, you better shake it off
What?
Sh-Sh-Shake it off, or get banged on
Gettin' my bang on, red strings on
Luis Vuitton kicks, Luis Vuitton frames on
Luis Vuitton belt holdin' the fo'-five
You know who I am bitch, I'm Mr. Westside
This West West or nothin' - get your pistols, get your flag
Gangstas we love to sag, we cock it back and blast
Like booyaka-booyaka, we lay the party down
G-G-Game, Dogg Pound
Everybody get down
Look nigga, I nurture and breed
I ain't never gave a fuck about a bitches needs
And bitch niggaz try to invade our town
I'ma lay 'em down, spray the 'K and get out
Say goodbye to the '6-4, hello to the '6-trey
He ain't never seen hydraulics, look at his bitch face
Up, down - now watch my shit scrape
Daz call Snoop, I'ma Crip Walk to get Dre
And Blood Bounce back, heat on the track
Dribble rock like Wade and bounce like Shaq
Throw a O in the pot and watch it bounce right back
Like that (like that?) like that
You got them funny ass colors on, take it off
If you in the club with ice on we takin' off
I thought you was a gangsta nigga, you better shake it off
What?
Sh-Sh-Shake it off, or get banged on
We street connected, respected, I gets pathetic
When I did it I must admit it, so nigga go and rep it
Lil' homies around her constantly on smash mode
Lil' niggaz with pistols that blowin' out your asshole
Bang how we give it, the culture that we live in
Fresh out the hospital or fresh out the prison
Real niggaz for life, the roots of the G tree
N.W.A., Dr. D-R-E
We not S-T-A-R's, we don't put stars in our shoes
Bitch we put the whole car on the shoes
You don't wanna see my car on the news
I'll "Set It Off" like Queen Latifah, red beam on the nina
Bang out, chippin' in traffic, dippin' the classic
Dippin' to classics, whoopin' that ass
It's hood niggaz ready to get it, your bitch can get it
Cause I know she'll suck a dick in less than a minute
'Cause, I'ma have to show him where the house at
Two milli macks, semi-automatic situational attack
In the back with a sack, Cadillac all black
Like this and like that
Bang, broken like glass and plastic
Bang out on him with the mask and plastic
We got access to massive plastiques
Purchased last week, D.P.G.C.
Bang
You got them funny ass colors on, take it off
If you in the club with ice on we takin' off
I thought you was a gangsta nigga, you better shake it off
What?
Sh-Sh-Shake it off, or get banged on
Here come them outta town niggaz, what up Blood?
(What up 'cause? They don't even know what 2Pac first album was)
Should I tell 'em Blood? (Nah, fuck 'em loc)
Me and Kurupt three-wheelin' on the hundred spokes
(Dash, brake, bounce and scrape)
Run up on the '6-4, see the AK's
(Bang) like Eazy, (Bang) like Dre
(Bang) like Snoop, (Bang) in L.A.
(Bang) like Crips and Bloods
From now on, wear a Bathing Ape hoodie get stripped in the club
Like a bitch in the club, watch him strip in the club
You like ice creams? Get a banana split in the club
No jewelry, you can't wear shit in the club
And that go for every nigga and bitch in the club
So you better take it off 'fore you get in the club
Game and Dogg Pound along side sittin' on dubs
Remember that
You got them funny ass colors on, take it off
If you in the club with ice on we takin' off
I thought you was a gangsta nigga, you better shake it off
What?
Sh-Sh-Shake it off, or get banged on
(Compton, Compton, Compton)

Walking through Compton, Eazy still alive
Raider hat to the back throw your dubs in the sky
My flowetry wicked, sit back while I kick it
And do it like Dre did it, N.W.A. did it
I cook crack like the first nigga that ever bought a brick
From a ese, nigga I could write an essay
About all the gangsta niggas that I seen lowridin
In they Chevys with a bitch riding shotgun reppin L.A
Crips, Bloods, homes going loco

Nigga I smoke chronic, ain't shit changed
Since Young MC and Eazy-E was rapping "We All in the Same Gang"
Some niggas chain hang, other niggas gangbang
I do both cause I'm the king of the motherfucking West coast
Kick the door open, Will let's go
Flow like Esco', New York niggas say I'm the best yo
Hard like Timbos, blowing on indo
Niggas try to play me, get stretched out like a limo
I was chopping crack when Dre was banging my demo
And all you old niggas is washed up like N.O
Don't take it the wrong way, I got love for my kinfolk
Can I get a moment of silence Will bang the instrumental
I spit for my niggas in the line-up
That'll never see the sun again, so I close my blinds up
First album sold them out, Impalas rolled them out
Cause the whole motherfucking world wanna know about

Welcome to the city of G's
Where we eat fried chicken, rice, and black-eyed peas
Fans got us in-the-scope, like Jimmy Iovine
Cause we Ruthless, like Will before the Black Eyed Peas
Fuck all rappers, look at all the hate I see
I'm sick, you can't get rid of me, I'm HIV
Nigga get another job, hip-hop is not hiring
I'm the reason Dre feel comfortable retiring
I just might put out "Detox" myself
Smoke so much, I check in detox myself
One man army, took out Reeboks myself
45. in my khakis gotta watch my health
I'm so hard nigga, Glock 17 quick draw nigga
Like the old me, 17, sippin malt liquor
All black khaki suit, all black Converse
Nigga Imma keep on stomping coming Straight Outta
(Compton, Compton, Compton)

Turn me up in the headphones a little, I want everybody to hear this shit
Chorus
This is my confession, you can take time to listen or turn your back on me, but this my confession, the life of a troubled child who grew up to be a gangster, look at me now
Game
How the fuck would you feel if you had to share every meal, every night with your foster brothers and sisters, I think about my mom and I missed her, nights after watching the A-Team when I kissed her. I used to want to be Mr. T or Murdoc, which one was it uhhh, than I heard shots, it was coming from a 133rd block, where them Westside piru niggas birds pop, and the crips ain't far way you got nothing block gray streets in the PJ's when niggas 15 years old with beards like freeway and you can die over he say and she say. Like your cousin told my brothers baby mama that game did started that drama in the projects, yeah the same one that they said carmello got robbed at, but I talked to him he said it didn't happen, nigga you play ball, I be the rapper. I don't give a fuck about nba ass niggas (fuck em') anyway nigga, I aint make it nigga I play ball, nigga im jealous nigga. You don't play for the lakers anyway.
Chorus
Lil' Eazy
Everybody wanna know about eazys son, till I raise my white tee and they seen this gun, yeah the second coming of a nigga with a attitude out of compton, a 100 miles miles and running, kelly park to the rucker they don't like me to fuck em', the shit in my blood so ima die a hustler, its nothing, when we ride through your hood busting that 6-4 impala that some color as mustard, eric wright junior, nigga the shoe fit, never thought I be in new york fuckin' with whookid, you niggas is stupid, homie I'm the blueprint, blue chucks on me walking a blue pit, 7:45 same blue tint, the diary of a mad man, heres my two cents, I stared in my pops eyes when he was in his last days, how he go from bronchitis and die from aids, fuck that
[Chorus]
Got to live for today cause tomorrow ain't promised to me
Don't just want a piece I want my whole destiny
(If you got it)
I'm gone take it
(If you're in it)
You're coming with me
(Bench warmers)
Get no playing time
(No sleeping)
Till I cross the line
I'm runnin'
[The Game]
With 99 miles left, on the Avis rental car
blowing horns like Miles Davis at the pearly gate
God let me in
Give me a room by Aaliyah with ESPN
I know I got more sins than two lesbians
Been back and forth across the border like Mexicans
But (I'm runnin') like New York pedestrians
Trying not to scuff my Nike Air checks again
It's funny how niggaz be the best of friends
And fall out over pussy and wanna dead they man
One of my niggaz in the grave the other one in the pen
She fucking my enemies inside my homeboys Benz
Now she beggin God's mercy cause she ain't listen to Nas
And never heard about Ike and the Iverson jersey
He got a cousin named Jayceon that rocked the Gary Payton
Now the same trifling bitch is a HIV patient
True story
[Chorus]
Got to live for today cause tomorrow ain't promised to me
Don't just want a piece I want my whole destiny
(If you got it)
I'm gone take it
(If you're in it)
You're coming with me
(Bench warmers)
Get no playing time
(No sleeping)
Till I cross the line
I'm runnin'
[Tony Yayo]
If I get knocked with my blunt nigga I'm runnin'
If I catch a murder one nigga I'm runnin'
Homicide come around and they keep on coming
That's why I'm out of state and I keep on runnin'
I ain't Nelly but my desert eagles on girl
Just dropped bail traveling the world
When I sign my deal I said fuck jail
I went on tour to Barcelona and Brazil
This shit real fuck an appeal
D's want my head like that bitch in Kill Bill
Sling dope slang crack and them 'E' pills
That's why I'm on the low like a dead navy seals
I'm runnin'
[Chorus]
Got to live for today cause tomorrow ain't promised to me
Don't just want a piece I want my whole destiny
(If you got it)
I'm gone take it
(If you're in it)
You're coming with me
(Bench warmers)
Get no playing time
(No sleeping)
Till I cross the line
I'm runnin'
[Game]
Cause I gotta pack them shows
And Dre told me aint no coming back from Go
So I gotta get my album in place
My G-Unit features
My Eminem sixteens
My Dr. Dre beats
And it was two years from today when I started rhymin
And took my demo to Suge and he aint sign me
Niggaz threatenin my life like its hard to find me
See me shining in the hood like twenty inch Lexanis
My mom said I'm hard head
I don't follow the rules
Why should I when Reebok giving niggaz they own shoes
And I'm dealing with the same problems 50 Cent got
Yayo in jail and they think Im tryin to take his spot
Im in the studio laughing at Chris Rock
Then I turn on MTV and see Soulja Slim shot
And niggaz trying to gun me down in the rim shop
Cause I just want the same recognition that the crips got
They say I'm the next in-line and if I get shot
Then I go out as the Bobby Fisher of hip hop
Make yo chest move
Sylvia Rome and Kevin Lyle slept cool
Jimmy Iovine was the best move
Yo Havoc, I'm too close to the edge on this one nigga
I ain't gon' jump though, I'mma keep it raw gutter
Yo Prodigy, you know I need you on this one nigga
I got shit on my chest, I must confess
Last night I was the nigga that shot up your projects
Now I'm back in the hood, with rocks in the Pyrex
Tan khakis and them Nike Airs with the dyed checks
I was forced to live this life, forced to bust my chrome
My pops left me in a foster home
I felt abandoned like Quik now that Mausberg gone
So I don't hop in the SS without the Mossberg homes
I've been rappin' for a year and a half, my life is real
Put the gun in his mouth, he gon' bite the steel
Come to Compton, I got stripes for real
Before Dre, before the ice, before the deal - I was almost killed
Like 'Pac before the Death Row deal
I got shot over two pounds of weed, still ain't found them niggas
But karma come quicker for a nigga on the other side of the gun
That's somethin I gotta teach my son
I don't need your love, no no no no
I don't need your love
Need it, I don't want it, I don't need it
I don't need your love, no I don't need your love
I don't need your love
Cause, the, game, don't, change
I heard they got Bloods in New York now
Red rags in Uptown Harlem now, I need that love
Front court at the Knicks game, new chick, French name
New car, new house, and sometimes friends change
And you don't need that love, when you G's like us
And your Jesus piece is sim-u-lar to Biggie's
And your life story is sim-u-lar to 50's
First they hate you, then they love you, then they hate you again
What the fuck do it take for a gangsta to win?
No mics, no Unsigned Hype, nigga fuck The Source
Plus them awards I don't need
And them niggas breathing the same air as me, acting like they don't bleed
We don't drive the same speed, this a Continental T
That's a case of Armadale, this a continental suite
So I'mma drown in my own sorrows
Live life, fuck tomorrow, nigga cause reality is
I don't need your love, no no no no
I don't need your love
Need it, I don't want it, I don't need it
I don't need your love, no I don't need your love
I don't need your love
Cause, the, game, don't, change
I was gassed up, Murder Inc., Roc-A-Fella passed up
Sat in Daddy's House with Black Rob and Lou and asked Puff
Now The Game's set in stone, the Franck Muller's set in stones
Dre cut me a check, I'm gone
Tryin to be the king of the streets, niggas'll wet your throne
But I got nieces to feed, two coasts to please
So I roam through the city like the ghost of E
Gotta put Compton back where it's 'sposed to be
Nothing between all my niggas that's close to me
In the streets with two fellas packing toast for me
I'm 'posed to be, got all the critics watching my pivot
On my block in the Coupe reading kites from prison
I got niggas doing life in prison
All my fallen soldiers is one of the reasons we pour out liquor
So this song is for Ms. Wallace, Afeni Shakur
And all the mothers of dead sons that went out in the war
I don't need your love, no no no no
I don't need your love
Need it, I don't want it, I don't need it
I don't need your love, no I don't need your love
I don't need your love
Cause, the, game, don't, change
I don't need your love, no no no no
I don't need your love
Need it, I don't want it, I don't need it
I don't need your love, no I don't need your love
I don't need your love
Cause, the, game, don't, change
Get a blunt, roll the weed, light it up nigga
Sippin' on Gin & Juice, fill up your cups nigga
The West Coast back crackin' like it's '94
So bitch get on your knees and give me head like it's '94
And don't come up for air 'til the beat drop
I'm the Doctor's Advocate
Call it a sneak peak at the motherfucking "Detox"
Take note, grab a pen
And let the world know the West is ridin' again
I graduated from Dre school, top of my class
Treat my switches like my bitches, got 'em droppin' that ass
Still bangin' The Chronic like Doggystyle came with it
And I roll up sticky on my bitch back while I hit it
I done Been There, Done That, had beefs and won that
5 million records on one plaque, I hung that
Still got Dr. Dre lowridin' in the '6-4
When you see us throw it up for the fucking
(West Coast)
My heart beat for the (West Coast)
We grow the best weed on the (West Coast)
We lowride on the (West Coast)
So I'mma die throwing up the (West Coast)
My heart beat for the (West Coast)
We grow the best weed on the (West Coast)
Still lowridin' on the (West Coast)
You should take a trip and visit the (West Coast)
Check game, I'mma show you how to bang
Uncle Snoopy is it true you from that 20 gang?
All the time neph', I gotta let my nuts hang
A chest full of chains, left hand with a pinky ring
I'm in a Steeler cap, Swisher Sweet peel 'em back
My lil' hoodrat, baby got that mini mac
Baby got that twenty sack, baby got plenty that
Whatever you send us my nucca, we gon' send it back
I'm in the club with the snub gettin' love
With 20,000 Crips and 20,000 Bloods and
We don't give a fuck about none of y'all
And when you hit the city, you better holla at the Bigg Dogg
I done seen niggas hit L.A. and get they chain snatched
Then they call me up beggin' me to get they chain back
What I look like, the motherfuckin' police?
There's certain rules you got to follow when you in these streets
Especially when it comes to this Cali shit
And I ain't talkin' bout hangin' in the valley bitch
Gangbang niggas all up in the alley, Crip
On some real talk nigga we the real ones
(West Coast)
My heart beat for the (West Coast)
We grow the best weed on the (West Coast)
We lowride on the (West Coast)
So I'mma die throwing up the (West Coast)
My heart beat for the (West Coast)
We grow the best weed on the (West Coast)
Still lowridin' on the (West Coast)
You should take a trip and visit the (West Coast)
I heard the blue rag niggas ain't fucking
With the red rag niggas on the West Coast (Fuck you mean?)
Shit, from what I seen, red and blue can make green
Black Wall Street and X only
Since jealousy breeds hatred, hatred breeds violence
Violence breeds enemies, more permanent silence
California alliance, it's more important than ever
So throw it up, we lowridin' together (yeah!)
Make the West Coast rise forever
Eses, Bs and Cs represent your letter
Got Game the go-getter, Xzibit the rhyme spitter
Snoop Dogg the boss, we gangsta at all costs
Y'all niggas is so soft and pussy so fuck off
'Fore one of my niggas draw that hammer and dump off
It's kush, you gon' cough {*cough-cough*}
Yeah, inhale the smoke
Bandana hang, bang the Coast my nigga
(West Coast)
My heart beat for the (West Coast)
We grow the best weed on the (West Coast)
We lowride on the (West Coast)
So I'mma die throwing up the (West Coast)
My heart beat for the (West Coast)
We grow the best weed on the (West Coast)
Still lowridin' on the (West Coast)
You should take a trip and visit the (West Coast)

(Verse 1)
He signed with Dre he gone sell
will he do a mill plus or will he end up in jail
Get real close to the speaker i got a story to tell
He went from the front porche to the cover of double XL,
I took one in the heart
I'm ready to die
And all this hennessey will make a nigga crash the G5
Catch me at a stop sign nigga I ain't drunk
I'm gangsta I'll pop mine leave you eyein' the punk
Tie your faggat arse up
Let you die in the trunk
I'm from westside compton nigga i ain't a punk
streets is talkin' is he from cali? is he from queens? do e ghost for P.Diddy can he write me a 16
Did he take 5 shots? Is he a blood or a crip? Ride through the CPT ma hood painted on the ricks
and ima die with an empty clip cos im a ghetto boy i just rap alot like J.Prince
(chorus)
In '99 i studied the chronic inside out
Ate doggystyle for breakfast lunch was reasonable doubt
I dint know how to count bars i was writtin on napkins high as fuck i wrote my 1st 16 the illmatic
I was in the hood fightin with niggaz..over who the best MC Ice Cube, Snoop Dogg or Xzibit
And now the east been makin the killin
since them long beach niggaz walked through new york and crushed the buildings
then this MARCY project nigga came and stole the crown
Right after the king of NY got shot down
10 years later im in harlem killin the mix tapes
they like me i want 'em to love me like they love mase
But ??? ??? ??? niggaz tell you they hate me and the plan is to catch me with my gun on safety
Nigga I'm still breathin
i ain't dead
next time you try to kill me put one in my head
(Chorus)
Before Jimmy Ivene the kill was ??? these bitch niggaz tried to take my life for 5 G's
I was in the projects 2 o'clock in the mornin playin' madden niggaz kicked in the door an start blastin'
Nigga I'm a gangsta I don't need no pity
I just sit inside the ferrari and roll up a philly
And i've been compared to shine like shine was compared to Biggy
I'm from Compton he from New York City
C'mon really you gotta be kiddin'
ain't nobody Biggy but Biggy
But Ima 6 figgy niggy and i know 50
But that don't mean I can get you backstage at awards
Or cos you went to high school tht ima take you on tour
Cos he got 2 bodyguards and can't get hit with the 4
And cos he wear a vest don't make him Tupac Shakur
When you see me in the streets ain't no security guards No L.A.P.D No bullet proof cars IMA GANGSTA
(Chorus)

Yeah, Fort Knocks, Aftermath, Compton to Jersey
What y'all fools know about perculatin on lo-los?
Mics and six-fo's nigga
Ha ha, no more hand claps, please nigga
Here we go - Just Blaze!
To all my niggas on the porch gettin they hair braided
Cornrowed by a L.A. bitch
And I can't forget, my niggas ridin the train, Yankee fitted
Snub nose under that Pelle shit
I love New York, but gangbangin that's L.A. shit
And I'm proud of it, spit it through the wire so the crowd love it
Haters you know who you are, you can turn it down, fuck it {*volume fades*}
{*volume rises*} I can shoot a video to it and spend half the budget
I'm gangster, let the 40 cal blow in public
More hatred inside my soul than 'Pac had for Delores Tucker
Every time one of my niggas get shot, the more I suffer
Cause we trapped inside a world where you forced to die for your colors
I seen it all through the Range tints
Got niggas doin life in the state pen
So I dread like Jamaicans
If I die for one of my statements
Then break up the streets of Compton
Spread my blood in the pavement
Believe me
Niggas keep sayin they gon' heat me up
Talkin that shit like they gon' lay me down
But when I come through strapped to see what's up
Niggas really don't want no parts of me pal
Believe me
Niggas keep sayin they gon' heat me up
Talkin that shit like they gon' lay me down
But when I come through strapped to see what's up
Niggas really don't want no parts of me pal
Who I gotta talk to, who I gotta write
Get my Reebok deal done or I'm stayin in Air Nikes, aight?
I handle bars, you ain't gotta ride a bike
To beat Game in his skills, here go some trainin wheels
Let's roll, through the City of God, where niggas trained to kill
We'll chop you up a hundred times worse than the Haitians will
F'real, nah f'real I need a track homey
Dre we too close, ain't no turnin back homey
Deal with it, I'mma be here for ten years
Spittin like the ghost of Eric Wright and Big here
Let me paint this picture while you sit here
Thinkin in the back of your mind, this is the shit, yeah
I spit for niggas doin 25 on they fifth year
Ready to throw a nigga off the fifth tier
Them white boys in the Abercrombie & Fitch gear
And every nigga who ever helped me to get here
Believe me
Niggas keep sayin they gon' heat me up
Talkin that shit like they gon' lay me down
But when I come through strapped to see what's up
Niggas really don't want no parts of me pal
Believe me
Niggas keep sayin they gon' heat me up
Talkin that shit like they gon' lay me down
But when I come through strapped to see what's up
Niggas really don't want no parts of me pal
It go one brick, two brick, the boy movin weight
Now three bricks, four bricks, I'm drivin upstate
Five bricks, six bricks, the nigga got cake
Not rap money, but money been wrapped since eighty-eight
Look at the world we live in, niggas steady hate
'til the Heckler and Koch, leave 'em chopped up like Freddie's face
Niggas catchin feelings cause I'm about millions
And out of all the newcomes out, my flow the illest
You a close second nigga, banana to a gorilla
Put us in the same cage, and I'mma have to peel him
The best of both worlds, rappin and drug dealin
Run and tell Lateef I came to burn down the village
The head honcho, starin out the third story window
Of my Beverly Hills condo
Two long-ass Heats, I call 'em Shaq and Alonzo
You niggas want me out of L.A., geah I know
Believe me
Niggas keep sayin they gon' heat me up
Talkin that shit like they gon' lay me down
But when I come through strapped to see what's up
Niggas really don't want no parts of me pal
Believe me
Niggas keep sayin they gon' heat me up
Talkin that shit like they gon' lay me down
But when I come through strapped to see what's up
Niggas really don't want no parts of me pal
Aight
Now, everybody wanna know the truth about a nigga named Game
I come from the hub and every ghetto ain't the same
A lot of people already know exactly where it's at
'Cause it's the home of the jackers and the crack, Compton
Yeah, that's the name of my hometown
I'm goin' down in the town where my name is all around
And niggaz just be hatin' and shit, that's a pity
But I ain't doin' nuttin' but claimin' my city
See my lyrics are double or nothin' provin' to suckers I can throw 'em
Pass the natural ten to four and six-eight before I go
Not really into freestylin' or tryin' to promote violence
But they gotta know about the five-five-fo', so
And that's how I'm livin', I do as I please B
A young gangsta put in work on these Cali streets
And everybody knows that you gotta be stompin'
If you're born and raised in Compton
Born and raised, born and raised
Born and raised, born and raised
Born and raised in Compton
Born and raised, born and raised
Born and raised, born and raised
Born and raised in Compton
Now, Compton is a place, where all my niggaz chill, dog
'Til I found out the streets get real dog
'Bout a year ago, somebody musta wanted me to die
'Cause they kicked in the door and gave the young kid five
They musta thought that I was gon' play the bitch role
'Cause I lived through fo' five six holes
But I ain't goin' out like no fagot-ass clown
They found, they couldn't keep a gangsta nigga down
So, here's the burner in your face, motherfucker, silly sucker
Ass clucker now you're duckin' cause you can't stop
A Y.G. gangsta 'cause I'm true to my game
You're lame, and thangs ain't gon' never be the same
'Cause a nigga like the Game is takin' over
I really don't think I should have to explain
Oh yeah, I'm a dog but my name ain't Rover
And I'm the kinda nigga that's feelin' no pain
Sometimes I have to wear a bulletproof vest
Because I got the CPT style written across my chest
A gangsta motherfucker never ceasin' to impress
My name is Young Game, so you can fuck, the rest
I'm comin' like this and I'm comin' directly
'Cause niggaz gettin' all stirred up, I'm doin' damage quite effectively
Rhymin' is a battle zone and niggaz can't win
'Cause I'm a gangsta from the C O M P T O N
[The Game]
Hey to Bust I think I got, the answer for all my problems
[Busta Rhymes]
What the fuck you talkin' about, nigga? Wha-What's that?
[The Game]
Belvedere, and Banana Snapple
[Busta Rhymes]
Look, get the fuckin' ass up, nigga
You over there tripin' up yaself nigaa,
You need to fuckin' calm, everybody bounce, nigga
[The Game]
I'ma man, and most of these niggas
Don't know how to be man, I got a son
[Busta Rhymes]
And what the fuck you talkin' about, nigga,
C'mon nigga, let's take ya ass to your crib, man,
You're tired, nigga, and put your drink down, nigga, we got to go, nigga
[The Game]
One more shot
[Chorus]
I didn't mean to walk away
But I hear every word they say
I guess my mind just drew a blank
Like (la la la)
Now I'm sittin' in this goddamn cage
Reminiscin' about my day
With your blood all over my Slate
As the devil sings (la la la)
[The Game]
Dre, I ain't mean to turn my back on you
But I'm a man, and sometimes a man do, what he gotta do
Remember, I'm from Compton too
I saw you and Eazy in 'em, so I started wearin' khaki suits
I was 12 smokin' chronic, in '92
I had a choice, be like Mike, or be like you
I made a choice, now its be Crip or be Piru
Whatever I was, I was bangin' 'Gin & Juice'
Never knew back then, I'd be friends with Snoop
Now I gotta keep it gangster, cause its in my roots
So I owe you my life, when I betrayed you
I tried to think of what the fuck Eminem might do
If every nigga hated him, for the 'Black Bitch' track
And niggas stopped bumpin' Dre after T-Boz got slapped
When Doc say its a rap, its a rap
Its still Aftermath and ain't nothing after that
[Chorus]
[The Game]
I never said 'Thank You', and I took for granted
You let me in your house, and made me a part of your family
Now I'm eatin' with you, Eve, and Busta Rhymes
I wasn't starstruck, I was just glad to be signed
And even though sometimes I run loose
You still my homeboy Doc, I'd take a bullet for you
I'm not askin' you to take my side in the beef
But you told me it was OK to say "Fuck The Police"
Now its my turn to carry the torch
And I still got the chain that you wore on the cover of The Source
Remember when we got drunk, to do "Start From Scratch"?
I told you you was like a father to me I meant that
Sittin' here lookin' at my platinum plaques
Thinkin' what the fuck am I without a Doctor Dre track
When Doc say its a rap - its a rap
Its still Aftermath and ain't nothing after that
[Chorus]
[Busta Rhymes]
See when the world is on your shoulder and the stress grows bigger
The fire in 'em, made it difficult to talk to the nigga
Most of the time I let 'em know I don't agree wit' what he do
But he a hard-head Dre thats why I'm talkin' to you
See when I first met my nigga son was layin' in the cut
Tight, reserve, homie was quiet and kept his mouth shut
Until you told him to spit for me, he flippin' from the gut
I dug his spirit, and I thought the dude was talented as fuck
And as the time went on, now he was workin' with the finest
I saw the pressure started to build, so I gave 'em additional guidance
You gave him something that can make or break a nigga you should face it
So big, I don't even think he was ready to embrace it
With the potential to be a strong nigga with conviction
The only problem was our little nigga wouldn't listen
But when Doc say its a rap, its a rap
Its still Aftermath and ain't nothing after that
[Chorus]
[Busta Rhymes]
Hey yo Game
[The Game]
Huh
[Busta Rhymes]
Yo Game, wake up nigga
[The Game]
I'm up man, I'm up
[Busta Rhymes]
We get you crib, nigga, get the fuck out the car, nigga, get up man
[The Game]
This aint my house, my house is, is green
[Busta Rhymes]
What the fuck you talkin', look, c'mon nigga, let's go man, walk yo, c'mon man
[The Game]
Alright, Hey Bus
[Busta Rhymes]
Nigga Where the keys at, nigga, need to open your door, nigga
[The Game]
I got love for you Bus, you're my nigga
[Busta Rhymes]
Get to your fuckin bed, go sleep, nigga, you're tired
Nigga, and don't fuckin drink like that no more,
Man you fuckin look like Ned the Worm you drunk motherfucker
[The Game]
Just going to the studio
[Busta Rhymes]
Go to sleep nigga
When the gang sings go up
You see your life flash right before your eyes
And you know what
That's how it is on the west side
When them gang sings go up
So many of my niggas died
Better watch what you throw up
Niggas talking all that shit
But when them gang sings go up
You see your life flash right before your eyes
And you know what
That's how it is on the west side
When them gang sings go up
Dear God, I now know what I've done
Through my thoughts and my actions
And the things that I've said
Sometimes by mistake and sometimes on purpose, Amen
Got my mind on this murder, Impala's all gassed up
Got a black Mac 11 and it hit like a Mac truck
Product of bad luck, play it out on that movie screen
And to scope with some killers, almost die for moving green
My mama a felon, my daddy so long gone
My grandmama died at 18, left me all alone
All I got is my guns, bandanas, some weed
Left me with 2 dead brothers, my enemies gon' bleed
I'm masked up, suicidal, rest in peace to Hayes
Wasn't no killers where my niggas seen some better days
But California have you stressed out, a million ways to die
Gotta pull that vest out
'Cause when the gang sings go up
You see your life flash right before your eyes
And you know what
That's how it is on the west side
When them gang sings go up
So many of my niggas died
Better watch what you throw up
Niggas talking all that shit
But when them gang sings go up
You see your life flash right before your eyes
And you know what
That's how it is on the west side
When them gang sings go up
Fuck niggas gon' die, speaking homicide
Laid out in the street, let his mama cry
White chalk, black streets
Red rag, coke killer, watch 'em leak
Black on black crimes
Killing our own brothers
But what the fuck can we do
When you got on the wrong colors?
Take a breath, inhale, let it go, lights off
On that Impala, hit the switch, lay it low
Soon as you walk out the crib, we gon' blast
Hit the 110 and now the one time on your ass
In 4 minutes, you thought that you got away with it
Thought that shit was a dream, let us pray
'Cause when the gang sings go up
You see your life flash right before your eyes
And you know what
That's how it is on the west side
When them gang sings go up
So many of my niggas died
Better watch what you throw up
Niggas talking all that shit
But when them gang sings go up
You see your life flash right before your eyes
And you know what
That's how it is on the west side
When them gang sings go up
I was just a young nigga on the block
Just a young nigga on the block
Said I was just a young nigga on the block
Just another young nigga on the block
Suge signed Pac, it was on, 'cause I fuck with Dre
Straight Outta Compton was a product of N.W.A
But shit everything changed when Ice Cube went solo
Riding shotgun in my brother Fase Lolo
On my way to school, having shoot outs with the cholos
If it wasn't them, we getting jacked by the popo
In the tenth grade smoking weed on the low though
My momma ain't know though back of the class
With a Source magazine just flipping through the photos
Fuck with reasonable doubt but not when Pac was on the road though
In nineteen-nity five I started to bang
And I would do anything for one of them death row chains
A nigga would do anything for one of them death row chains
A nigga would do anything for one of them death row chains
A nigga would do anything for one of them death row chains
Even though he was born on the East, Pac was accepted here
Especially rocking that chain with that electric chair
I set back and watched him, threw up the West side
As Suge, Pac, Snoop and Dre hit the cover of the Vibe'96, it was on
I took adeath row sticker then slapped it on the chrome
Riding down Rosecrans with my hand on the toast
Stuck at a light, bumping "two of Amerikaz Most"
I used to spray it on a locker, a nigga run up
I yell, "death row" and sock him and I kept a gun tucked
Selling weed with my nigga Sonic
All we used to listen to was Doggystyle, All Eyez on Me and The Chronic
Then a couple Long Beach niggas changed the game
Daz and Kurupt, nigga, fuck O-Dog and Caine
But when Dr. Dre left, shit wasn't the same
And I would've did anything for that niggadeath row chain
A nigga would do anything for one of them death row chains
A nigga would do anything for one of them death row chains
A nigga would do anything for one of them death row chains
Dre started Aftermath and found Em
Eazy-E died from AIDS but why him?
Snoop signed to P, Suge signed Left Eye
Death Row fell apart, what happened to the West side?
I used to smoke and just sit in the truck
I was forced to bang Biggie and Puff
I was mad at niggas, feltdeath row ain't give us enough
And for that we ain't giving a fuck
The whole coast split it up, now Dre in New York working with Nas
And Pac stomping niggas out inside the mirage
I saw it on the news and I knew it was on
They say the look on Pac face, nigga knew he was wrong
Knew he was gone, stomp the nigga two minutes long
Know I'm repping West side, putting you in the song, damn
2Pac got smoked by Baby Lane
And both of them niggas dead over a fucking death row chain
A nigga would do anything for one of them death row chains
A nigga would do anything for one of them death row chains
A nigga would do anything for one of them death row chains
Oooooh-ooh-oh-ooh, ha-ha
Steady, are you ready? What's going on?
Steady, are you ready? Are you ready?
What's going on? What's going on?
Cold fresh air

Ayo it's time for the function
Time to bring dinner to all of these niggas luncheon
This for 2Pac, Heron, Bountry
Halloween mask, carve one of you pumpkins
Empty the pills out, fire up the purp now
Game is back, lil niggas pull your skirt down
Flow ice cold, Max Julian on a ho
Used to run the rock, Jim Brown in the snow
Moncler bomber, armor Under Armour
.38 special 'cause I believe in karma
Double entendre holding your Aunt Sandra
Then we can talk the location, I left your mama
Lost on the ganja, letting my mind wander
Made for the drama like a fucking mixtape
Use a Phantom in a drive-by nigga and switch plates
Getting the bigger pool the only way to diss Drake
And I'm coming
However do you want me? However do you need me?
However do you want me? However do you need me?
However do you want me? However do you need me?
However do you want me? However do you need me?
Don't compare me to shit, I ain't none of you niggas
I'll smoke your lil mafia in front of you nigga
Left Aftermath 'cause I wanted to nigga
Still pull up on Dre and smoke a blunt or two, nigga
It's lit, came in the game like a red nose pit
You got business in LA? I dead your shit
Shut video shoots down, turn airplanes around
Knowledge in belly anonymous rounds
Tryna host AOD and niggas lying you down
Of course the wolves can smell when vagina in town
Turn these niggas inside out like Killa Cam back
Intercepted at the airport, nigga the Rams back
Flying Spur, top missing like Ginobili
Grill all gold, that's my motherfucking whoadie
Love when niggas act like they don't know me
'Til I start shooting, remind 'em of the old Kobe
S'life
However do you want me? However do you need me?
(Whenever you want it, however you want it)
However do you want me? However do you need me?
(Whenever you want it, however you want it)

Cold fresh air
Feel the melody that's in the air
I'm bound, take a look around
What's going down?
However do you want me?
Nigga, I'm my own Suge, report to nobody
Give these niggas awards and they still nobodies
I don't go to the Grammys, nigga I bag those
Fuck the BET awards, I done had those
Fuck a freestyle, nigga this a cash flow
Young Jay and I ain't never had a Jaz-O
Ask Kanye "who the real asshole?"
Cuban links smoking a Cuban, Fidel Castro
Feet up at Mastero's, table full of models
I'mma fuck 'em all, right hand on the Bible
Head game crazy, mommy suicidal
Rubbing on my dick while she download Tidal
This the life of Pablo mixed with Mercielagos
A product of gin and juice inside of my baby bottle
Said this the life of Pablo mixed with Mercielagos
No more parties in LA or Chicago
Whenever you want it, however you want it
Whenever you want it, however you want it
Baby you know you got me going crazy
You run around my head like these waves
Yeah, baby you
You know that you the one that I adore
The one I introduce to Tom Ford at dinner
That was you
You'se the one I fell in love with
The one I move these drugs with
But now you on some fuck shit
Anybody but you
I ain't figured it that you would be the one to cut me
Leave me on the floor fucking bloody, Goddamn
Baby you, you had me fooled the whole time
Now you got me in King of Diamonds giving these hoes time
Girl, baby you
I can't blame you though
When you see the door, you see the door
Now listen, baby you
Every time I decide to leave you all in the past
Baby I be thinking 'bout you on the long drive, yeah
And you ain't no one make me feel unsatisfied, no
But baby you, you got me going

But you got me, you got me, you got me, you got me, you got me, yeah
You got me, you got me, you got me, you got me, you got me
Baby you, yeah, oh
Tell me how you think we living how we live?
Like you the one that put us in these cribs
Not me but baby you
Like I ain't getting money for these shows
I guess you think I'm tripping on these hoes
They fans but look at you
Who in them Celine bags? Who in them Giuseppes?
Louboutins, wanna bet me? I win 'cause it's you
You begged me to get on that show
I ain't want it but you did
I'm a real nigga I did it for you
You don't see Swizz and Alicia
Kim K and Kanye arguing all the time
It's just you
I begged you to marry me
Half a million dollars out my safe down the drain
But fuck it 'cause that was you
Damn we got some beautiful kids
But you never say it something we did
I guess your baby daddy you
Regardless of the shit we go through
I got Jason in the booth, 2 AM singing shit about you
Every time I decide to leave you all in the past
Baby I be thinking 'bout you on the long drive, yeah
And you ain't no one make me feel unsatisfied, no

Baby you, yeah, oh
These white people vote for Trump but they don't give a fuck about OJ
I watch the nigga whole TV show and still don't give a fuck about OJ
And don't go out like black OJ
Beat a murder, went to jail for some football cards, I can't go out like OJ
Seven forty-six, wake up, hand on my dick
Lakers lost by thirty last night, I'm talking shit
Roll up a Backwood, killer in my spliff
Reading GQ magazine while I take a shit
Walk back to my room, wake up this bitch
Kickin' her out, dick in her mouth, that Compton shit, boy
I'm on that monster shit, boy
Chopper out the trunk, on some Compton shit, boy
I remember flipping dimes and shit
Putting five to them planes, that La Bamba shit
Dr. Dre ain't got time for this, he wearing Beats
I got my ear to the ground, lil' nigga, I'm in these streets like
Streetlights and lead pipes, up in the projects
We gon' make it out but this shit is a slow process
Lean right, keep heat tight, don't ever digest
Hollow tips where your mind rest, you forgot
They don't make niggas like me (they don't make niggas like me, they don't make niggas like me)
Nah, they don't make niggas like me (they don't make niggas like me, they don't make niggas like me)
They don't make niggas like me (they don't make niggas like me, they don't make niggas like me)
They don't make niggas like me (they don't make niggas like me, they don't make niggas like me)
Wassup
I'm that nigga that sold packs by the bungalows
Animal out here, my niggas in the jungles know
I'm cold like one below in Green Bay
Had the water on the block, to the fiends I was a stingray
I had a Z before I seen Jay
I had the West, I used to sling yay
But sometimes when tables turn like a DJ
Had them rocks and them bands like Green Day
I used to listen to, project pepto straps and sell crack
Used to smoke that Bobby Brown, fuck rats and sit back
On my forte, was more yay, my enemies got gift-wrapped
The two nicks in two days, got new fits and new Js
Thankful for my two Ks, my vision clear as Blu-ray
Kill your ass today, knock the glue off your toupÃ©e
My guns like "hi", leave that shy shit to Lupe
Then chop the top off the coupe, doomsday
They don't make niggas like me (they don't make niggas like me, they don't make niggas like me)
Nah, they don't make niggas like me (they don't make niggas like me, they don't make niggas like me)
They don't make niggas like me (they don't make niggas like me, they don't make niggas like me)
They don't make niggas like me (they don't make niggas like me, they don't make niggas like me)
Cook crack nigga
When the gang sings go up
You see your life flash right before your eyes
And you know what
That's how it is on the west side
When them gang sings go up
So many of my niggas died
Better watch what you throw up
Niggas talking all that shit
But when them gang sings go up
You see your life flash right before your eyes
And you know what
That's how it is on the west side
When them gang sings go up
Dear God, I now know what I've done
Through my thoughts and my actions
And the things that I've said
Sometimes by mistake and sometimes on purpose, Amen
Got my mind on this murder, Impala's all gassed up
Got a black Mac 11 and it hit like a Mac truck
Product of bad luck, play it out on that movie screen
And to scope with some killers, almost die for moving green
My mama a felon, my daddy so long gone
My grandmama died at 18, left me all alone
All I got is my guns, bandanas, some weed
Left me with 2 dead brothers, my enemies gon' bleed
I'm masked up, suicidal, rest in peace to Hayes
Wasn't no killers where my niggas seen some better days
But California have you stressed out, a million ways to die
Gotta pull that vest out
'Cause when the gang sings go up
You see your life flash right before your eyes
And you know what
That's how it is on the west side
When them gang sings go up
So many of my niggas died
Better watch what you throw up
Niggas talking all that shit
But when them gang sings go up
You see your life flash right before your eyes
And you know what
That's how it is on the west side
When them gang sings go up
Fuck niggas gon' die, speaking homicide
Laid out in the street, let his mama cry
White chalk, black streets
Red rag, coke killer, watch 'em leak
Black on black crimes
Killing our own brothers
But what the fuck can we do
When you got on the wrong colors?
Take a breath, inhale, let it go, lights off
On that Impala, hit the switch, lay it low
Soon as you walk out the crib, we gon' blast
Hit the 110 and now the one time on your ass
In 4 minutes, you thought that you got away with it
Thought that shit was a dream, let us pray
'Cause when the gang sings go up
You see your life flash right before your eyes
And you know what
That's how it is on the west side
When them gang sings go up
So many of my niggas died
Better watch what you throw up
Niggas talking all that shit
But when them gang sings go up
You see your life flash right before your eyes
And you know what
That's how it is on the west side
When them gang sings go up
Alright let's do it
Baby let me know if you'll let me
You'll let me know, you'll let me know
You'll let me know, you'll let me know
You'll let me know, you'll let me know
Baby let me know if you'll let me
You'll let me know, you'll let me know
You'll let me know, you'll let me know
You'll let me know, you'll let me know
Where the body cams at when they killed Sandra Bland though?
Where the justice system at when the cops go Rambo?
Black lives matter when we talkin' about Philando
But all lives matter when we talkin' bout Orlando
49 dead bodies, 83 in France though
They say Alton had a gun, we ain't see it in his hands though
We screamin' fuck the police but what about Dallas?
All these murders on the news
Every week it's another one, DJ Khaled
How we gon' respect the badge if you don't protect and serve?
They say life ain't a movie but it's feelin' like The Purge
And this rag in my pocket match the blood in the curb
Hear the shots in the hood but can they feel it in the 'burbs?
Turn on the news, get seduced by the words
And the noose on the black man's neck sounds absurd
Summer 16 look like more than a Drake song
And that's just this year, y'all forgot about Trayvon?
Baby you'll let me know, you'll let me know
You'll let me know, you'll let me know
You'll let me know, you'll let me know
Why it take 3 days for Obama to respond?
'Cause Minnesota 3 days from the White House lawn
Trump and Hillary both cons
Backstab us like the bullets in the back of LaQuan
This ain't The Game, I come to you as Jayceon
With both of my hands up, don't shoot on my palms
Tamir Rice was just a kid and unarmed
Them cops was Cleveland fans, you just killed the next Lebron
We just need a resolution
When did being detained become a fuckin' execution?
Turn on the news, my stomach turnin' to knots
As the world keep turnin', I'm about to turn into Pac
I'm so determined, I promise to sing a sermon
Every night a mother dreads like Busta in Higher Learnin'
Candles burnin' so we marchin' up the blocks
Moment of silence every time a body drops
When the killin' gon' stop?
If they stop killin' us will we stop killin' cops?
Baby, you'll let me know, you'll let me know
You'll let me know, you'll let me know
You'll let me know, you'll let me know
Yeah, yeah
Now tell me, can you stand up?
Knowin' everybody can't stand us?
Don't they know that hate is a cancer?
Ask around, nobody got the answers
Now tell me, can you stand up?
Knowin' everybody can't stand us?
Didn't know we was livin' in Orlando
People dyin' with their hands up
Now I hope the whole world
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Uhhh, wake up, wake up, wake up
Let me know
Let me know
Somebody let me know
If we gone wake up, wake up, wake up
I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side
Staying alive was no jive
Had secondhands, mom's bounced on old man
So then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth, yo, rocking the gold tooth, 'Lo goose
Only way I be gettin' the G off was drug loot
And let's start it like this son
Rolling with this one and that one
(Red Wallabies) Buzzing with my Killa Beez
Chronic had my eyes chinky like Compton was the Philippines
Junior prom, red suit, Tasha in that limousine
Tryna suck the head off my dick like a guillotine
Came in her mouth, then gave her some Listerine
Put a condom on and let her grind it like a centipede
(Cash rules everything around me)
Before Dre found me, before my city crowned me
Bummy lil nigga, pussy niggas used to clown me
Had to wear my brother's clothes, them shits used to drown me
6 years passed now I'm banging in the county
Niggas that used to talk shit won't even come around me
Reciting Method Man while my celly just sit there
Niggas know I been on the Wu before Ric Flair
Came home through the hood, GX shining
Now these bitches think I'm Lex Diamonds
Nigga I grew up on Wu-Tang
Nigga I grew up on Wu-Tang
(Cash rules everything around me)
(Cash rules everything around me)
I grew up on Wu-Tang, dope had my shoe game Liu Kang
Jordan 12's sick as hell, Michael Jordan flu game
Glass jar, Pyrex, obsessed with the blue flame
Lexus coupe, rubbing on them titties boy, 2 Chainz
Top of the food chain, niggas wanna kill me
'Cause I turned into the plug, I'm where the chronic and the pills be
RZA with the rings, Ol' Dirty with the stainless
Five .38 revolvers, thirty-six chambers
Killah like Ghostface, as the Rollie rotate
Daytons on the S-Class equipped with the floor safe
And we had the stash spots with them red and blue tops
Chronic in the GLAAD lock, the dope spot padlocked
In the living room bagging shit up watching Matlock
Black Glock, crack rock bundled in my black socks
And my mama working late, skinny nigga serving weight
Let the chronic circulate the Purple Tape
Said I wake up in the morning
Spark one for the homies, they dead and gone, but I
But I'm never ever lonely
To your memory, my nigga, to your memory, my nigga
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
They dead and gone, but I
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
They dead and gone, but I
'Lil Frogg, nigga, I miss you
Your momma still wish she could kiss you
I talked to all the homies, yeah, all the homies
Swear that day we wish that we was with you
I remember when I first rolled up
Seen you laid out there on Rosecrans
It was Cedar Block and if you read about us
We was throwing that shit up with both hands
Make me wanna hop back in that old van
Take an Olde E and sip the whole can
But I'm out here, with your brother and your pops
All night, my nigga, I ain't got no plans
Your mom's out here having a fit
Big Frogg and the truck niggas sick
All the homies on the block getting lit
Putting everything they can into a clip
Yeah, to the street, it wasn't even Crips
Some of the homies trying to blame a bitch
Cause he was riding on sky today, he died
Wrong place, wrong time, nigga fucked up shit
But your funeral ain't nothing but love
Look around, it ain't nothing but Bloods
And let me tell you what a bitch nigga did
Took a good daddy away from seven kids
Said I wake up in the morning
Spark one for the homies, they dead and gone, but I
But I'm never ever lonely
To your memory, my nigga, to your memory, my nigga
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
They dead and gone, but I
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
They dead and gone, but I
Still riding around through the city looking for an enemy
Still riding around through the city thinkin' 'bout all the memories
Thinking back like God damn
All them niggas really really livin me
Wishing I knew what I knew now
Half them niggas wouldn't have been next to me
Nowadays, ain't too many niggas next to me
None of these bitches getting next me
I seen what it did to a good friend
That was God trying to lecture me
That was God trying open me
That's when God got close to me
I went through the fire, went through the pain
Now it's all hope for me
Now it's designer, in the ghost that they chauffeur me
My haters is mad, oh you know, they didn't go for me
They wish I was gone, they wish in the song somebody wrote for me
But I got the goat in me, I got the truth in me
You know what the fuck be pissing me off?
The other motherfuckers think they running my block
Jump off that fucking stoop, hit the fucking gate, nigga
Grab your burners it's time to go to war
I give the niggas the whole fucking clip
Every motherfucking round in this motherfucker you can get
Tell them it's a block thing
Murder murder, murder murder
Niggas run up on this red '64
You get a white tag on your big toe
These ain't punch lines, niggas kick doors
Leave your baby mama with her lip swole
All handguns, niggas pack light
Nigga's mouth loose but my strap tight
Niggas slide through and they bust first
We killin' everybody that night
Block wars, we 'bout that life
Scuffed J's and them fist fights
Dead bodies on dead bodies
Savage, that's what I live like
Go and chop a nigga head off
Fuck around, let the rounds hit you
Blood splattered on them niggas with you
All I had to do was give a signal
Magazines if you got an issue
Hit one nigga with the Source
Hit two niggas with the Vibe
Bitch I kill your vibe
It's a reason niggas can't fuck with Chuck
I'm a Compton nigga and I don't give a fuck
Nigga walk around with that pistol tucked
I do drive-by's out a Bentley truck
(Murder murder) Whoo! Yeah
Have you ever seen a murder huh?
(Murder murder) Boom-boom-boom-boom, look
Have you ever seen a murder?
Have you ever seen a dead body?
Got a chopper with some rounds on it

Cock your shit and walk around the corner
Promise nigga this ain't what you want (block wars)

Nigga this ain't what you want (block wars)
No, nigga this ain't what you want, whoo, yeah
(Murder murder) Boop boom boom boom
(Murder murder) Whoo
Pull up on your block, take that shit over
Stolen choppers out of stolen Rovers
Supernova bullets rippin' through Corollas
Pure shooter like DeMare DeRozan
Hot slugs but the jewelry frozen
Twelve gauges on the trap sofas
Naked bitches in the kitchen whippin' yola
Pockets fat like the young Oprah
Told the nigga he ain't want the clip
I'm filthy rich and still with the shit
His mama cryin' but his son a bitch
I had her view the body like she from the 6
Bullets ricochetin' all through the block
Nigga run his mouth like he knew the cops
I do the shootin' while the shooters watch
Then cook crack in a newer pot
Move me? Gotta move the block
That means take shots like it's Lou Dot
Niggas talkin' bout the game like it's ESPN
I'll put your ass with Stuart Scott
No conscious mind, the chronic got my mind blown
I can't stop with the murder shit
Burn rubber, burn a clip
A lot of niggas died on how they wear the shit
Shut the fuck up
Or get murdered, murdered, murdered
Have you ever seen a dead
Murder murder murder murder
Have you ever seen a dead body?

Let me lick you in places you never been licked before
Take you to places you never been before
Like London, Paris, see that Lamborghini outside
We can share it, J and B without the marriage
Horse and carriage, seÃ±orita
Snapchat dog filters live from Ibiza
Breakfast on the beach, that mean sex is on the beach
You lookin' like a fruit platter, I'ma bite into your peach
And um, I think about to massage your feet
And um, you got a body, you remind of my Jeep
And um, I must look amazing with you
'Cause every time you on my arm I got
All eyes on me

Put your body on me
You the one I'm missin'

'Member when you used to curve me, leave my text message unread?
And every time I asked to see you, you say you goin' to bed
Every time I hit you with the good morning you say you workin'
Now you in my living room twerkin', that's crazy
You wear that body suit, I know you tryna tease me
I put on that Tiller, she'd rather fuck me to Weezy
I remember when your money was young
And you stripped all week just to get the tan Yeezy's
Back when lame niggas hit you with the one liners
All sounding the same like Future and Desiigner
Now that's my vagina, she told me to sshh
We in the Chanel store and

Girl, you know my intentions

Round after round to decisions
Say you wanna show me what I'm missin'
All the lights low, but we lit up
I don't let you down if I get up
Like you got a man, but you're fed up (You want me to say your name huh?)
But you know when we get together (Karrueche)

Used to run the rock, Jim Brown in the snow
Moncler bomber, armor Under Armour
.38 special 'cause I believe in karma
Double entendre holding your Aunt Sandra
Then we can talk the location, I left your mama
Lost on the ganja, letting my mind wander

Love when niggas act like they don't know me
'Til I start shooting, remind 'em of the old Kobe
S'life
However do you want me? However do you need me?
(Whenever you want it, however you want it)
However do you want me? However do you need me?
(Whenever you want it, however you want it)
However do you want me?
(Whenever you want it, however you want it)
Cold fresh air
Feel the melody that's in the air
I'm bound, take a look around
What's going down?
However do you want me?
Nigga, I'm my own Suge, report to nobody
Give these niggas awards and they still nobodies
I don't go to the Grammys, nigga I bag those
Fuck the BET awards, I done had those
Fuck a freestyle, nigga this a cash flow
Young Jay and I ain't never had a Jaz-O
Ask Kanye "who the real asshole?"
Cuban links smoking a Cuban, Fidel Castro
Feet up at Mastero's, table full of models
I'mma fuck 'em all, right hand on the Bible
Head game crazy, mommy suicidal
Rubbing on my dick while she download Tidal
This the life of Pablo mixed with Mercielagos
A product of gin and juice inside of my baby bottle
Said this the life of Pablo mixed with Mercielagos
No more parties in LA or Chicago
Whenever you want it, however you want it
Whenever you want it, however you want it
I was just a young nigga on the block
Just a young nigga on the block
Said I was just a young nigga on the block
Just another young nigga on the block
Suge signed Pac, it was on, 'cause I fuck with Dre
Straight Outta Compton was a product of N.W.A
But shit everything changed when Ice Cube went solo
Riding shotgun in my brother Fase Lolo
On my way to school, having shoot outs with the cholos
If it wasn't them, we getting jacked by the popo
In the tenth grade smoking weed on the low though
My momma ain't know though back of the class
With a Source magazine just flipping through the photos
Fuck with reasonable doubt but not when Pac was on the road though
In nineteen-nity five I started to bang
And I would do anything for one of them death row chains
A nigga would do anything for one of them death row chains
A nigga would do anything for one of them death row chains
A nigga would do anything for one of them death row chains
Even though he was born on the East, Pac was accepted here
Especially rocking that chain with that electric chair
I set back and watched him, threw up the West side
As Suge, Pac, Snoop and Dre hit the cover of the Vibe'96, it was on
I took adeath row sticker then slapped it on the chrome
Riding down Rosecrans with my hand on the toast
Stuck at a light, bumping "two of Amerikaz Most"
I used to spray it on a locker, a nigga run up
I yell, "death row" and sock him and I kept a gun tucked
Selling weed with my nigga Sonic
All we used to listen to was Doggystyle, All Eyez on Me and The Chronic
Then a couple Long Beach niggas changed the game
Daz and Kurupt, nigga, fuck O-Dog and Caine
But when Dr. Dre left, shit wasn't the same
And I would've did anything for that niggadeath row chain
A nigga would do anything for one of them death row chains
A nigga would do anything for one of them death row chains
A nigga would do anything for one of them death row chains
Dre started Aftermath and found Em
Eazy-E died from AIDS but why him?
Snoop signed to P, Suge signed Left Eye
Death Row fell apart, what happened to the West side?
I used to smoke and just sit in the truck
I was forced to bang Biggie and Puff
I was mad at niggas, feltdeath row ain't give us enough
And for that we ain't giving a fuck
The whole coast split it up, now Dre in New York working with Nas
And Pac stomping niggas out inside the mirage
I saw it on the news and I knew it was on
They say the look on Pac face, nigga knew he was wrong
Knew he was gone, stomp the nigga two minutes long
Know I'm repping West side, putting you in the song, damn
2Pac got smoked by Baby Lane
And both of them niggas dead over a fucking death row chain
A nigga would do anything for one of them death row chains
A nigga would do anything for one of them death row chains
A nigga would do anything for one of them death row chains
[Verse]
This that sick rap, kick back, come to where I pitch at
Where b****** love The Game like Tyson Beckford six pack
Presidential Rollie, n****, where your wrist at?
I can kill you in four bars, that's a Kit Kat
Did the Lambo my way with a sick wrap
Smooth as Frank Sinatra with a m************ slick back
No rats in my pack, ain't no wrinkles in my slacks
Counting singles in my Shaqs, stacking Pringles from the crack
N**** I was on the bus with it
Had 12 stuck to my chest in the field with the colt
Andrew Luck with it
We had the rock, hit the block like what's up with it
Jay was in the Z, my young gunnas in the truck with it
Sigel would've loved it, Philly would've f***** with it
California state property you n***** stuck with it
Brrrring, sold Peedi Crakk
Game was on the block in his beanie with a Mac
I'm what you rap n***** 'fraid of
A Compton n**** that could go bar for bar with Jada
Let me tell you who suck, like banana Now or Laters
Blac Chyna head the bomb, al-Qaeda
Listen, you want beef I'll cater
Game snap on everything he like a f****** wild gator
Silver and black Ghost, n**** that's Al Davis
Give me Left Eye back, take Fetty Wap and the Raiders
The Rams is back, them bullets getting tossed
16 on your back like you f****** Jeff Goff
Your man acting girly too put 30 on his chest
Kanye shrug b****, welcome to the west
YG, Nipsey, and Kendrick yea check
Shout 'em out I just do it like a f****** Nike rep
Bentley truck Chuck, with the Henny cupped up
Don't get me f***** up, you see the semi tucked, duck
Pass the Goose, where them duck ducks?
These hoes foaming at the mouth, they got Penny f***** up
I'm 'bout to poke 'em like a cactus
Told that b**** to roll the Philly for the game, and she talking about practice
The Maybach is A.I
Artificial intelligence m*********** that's Junior Seau
All my doors suicide, I'm in Vegas shoot the five
Tell the dealer pay me don't be shy he ain't from Do or Die
Now do you wanna ride, back seat of my Caddy?
Used to flip them pies ain't no relation to Patti
And I move Ps, ain't no relation to Swaggy
Before that it was missing teeth and nickel sack baggies
That's caine, no daddy cause I ain't really have one
And you can't call yourself dope if you ain't never bag none
I'm the old DMX you n***** Drag-On
Game raw as f*** like poking holes in the Magnum
Used to ether the n***** in all of my 16s
Now I scare 'em once a year like I'm f****** Halloween
This ain't a dream, n**** hurricane a nightmare
Stab you in your sleep and smack your baby out his highchair
Your daddy was a b****, I had to do it
I ain't need no ski mask to do it
Murder is Rihanna and I'm attracted to it
Name a state, I'll send a package through it
If the fed hack into it, they get bossed on like I'm Massachusetts
Sitting in this Maybach with music
Your head is like Mustard beat and I'll put the ratchet to it
PARTY sent my jackas to it
Drama bring the Mac into it
And this scope will get your mouth washed when I attach it to it
Gold on my neck, I make your b**** put her back into it
Usain Bolt if you bring a real track into it
Another classic moving the way to Aftermath to do it
Dre had the Chronic all I did was put the matches to it
Traffic moving backwards through it
Ever since I had the Buick
Known for putting cheese on n***** heads the way the Packers do it
And I had the yay, yea I brought crack to music
Every situation in rap, I've been a savage through it
And all these hoes getting mad cause I'm smashing through 'em
They can get a ring one day, if the Cavs can do it
Be LeBron b****, I'm Jayceon b****
Who else you seen parked at the swap meet in James Bond s***?
Another foreign car driven by a convict
Aventador matte black Akon lips
Nas ether n*****, Game napalm s***
N***** say my name I pop up like the State Farm b****
No n**** can see me, on or off TV
Gun by them Yeezys, I'm the 6' 5
Baby you know you got me going crazy
You run around my head like these waves
Yeah, baby you
You know that you the one that I adore
The one I introduce to Tom Ford at dinner
That was you
You'se the one I fell in love with
The one I move these drugs with
But now you on some fuck shit
Anybody but you
I ain't figured it that you would be the one to cut me
Leave me on the floor fucking bloody, Goddamn
Baby you, you had me fooled the whole time
Now you got me in King of Diamonds giving these hoes time
Girl, baby you
I can't blame you though
When you see the door, you see the door
Now listen, baby you
Every time I decide to leave you all in the past
Baby I be thinking 'bout you on the long drive, yeah
And you ain't no one make me feel unsatisfied, no
But baby you, you got me going
But you got me going, you got me going
But you got me, you got me, you got me, you got me, you got me, yeah
You got me, you got me, you got me, you got me, you got me
Baby you, yeah, oh
Tell me how you think we living how we live?
Like you the one that put us in these cribs
Not me but baby you
Like I ain't getting money for these shows
I guess you think I'm tripping on these hoes
They fans but look at you
Who in them Celine bags? Who in them Giuseppes?
Louboutins, wanna bet me? I win 'cause it's you
You begged me to get on that show
I ain't want it but you did
I'm a real nigga I did it for you
You don't see Swizz and Alicia
Kim K and Kanye arguing all the time
It's just you
I begged you to marry me
Half a million dollars out my safe down the drain
But fuck it 'cause that was you
Damn we got some beautiful kids
But you never say it something we did
I guess your baby daddy you
Regardless of the shit we go through
I got Jason in the booth, 2 AM singing shit about you
Every time I decide to leave you all in the past
Baby I be thinking 'bout you on the long drive, yeah
And you ain't no one make me feel unsatisfied, no
But baby you, you got me going
But you got me going, you got me going
But you got me, you got me, you got me, you got me, you got me, yeah
You got me, you got me, you got me, you got me, you got me
Baby you, yeah, oh

I'ma start beefing with Cole, Drizzy and Cornrow Kenny
Or you could pick your favorite rapper, and he gon' be pouring out Henny
I got a b**** from Minne-Apolis pack a semi
Bang the ratchet at Denny's and fly herself back to Philly
She got a couple mill and she don't even know Meek
And ever since that n**** snitched on me we just don't speak
See that s*** you got with Drake is like a slow leak
Blood'll be dripping like Niagara if I poke Meek
Nicki won't get no sleep, I'm coming through at 4 a.m
Four deep, to leave his dead body on the soaked sheets
It could happen lowkey
You better have Ross call me or you gon' be eye level with a roach feet
This ain't a diss, n****

Ayo it's time for the function
Time to bring dinner to all of these niggas luncheon
This for 2Pac, Heron, Bountry
Halloween mask, carve one of you pumpkins
Empty the pills out, fire up the purp now
Game is back, lil niggas pull your skirt down
Flow ice cold, Max Julian on a ho
Used to run the rock, Jim Brown in the snow
Moncler bomber, armor Under Armour
.38 special 'cause I believe in karma
Double entendre holding your Aunt Sandra
Then we can talk the location, I left your mama
Lost on the ganja, letting my mind wander
Made for the drama like a fucking mixtape
Use a Phantom in a drive-by nigga and switch plates
Getting the bigger pool the only way to diss Drake
And I'm coming
However do you want me? However do you need me?
However do you want me? However do you need me?
However do you want me? However do you need me?
However do you want me? However do you need me?
Don't compare me to shit, I ain't none of you niggas

Left Aftermath 'cause I wanted to nigga
Still pull up on Dre and smoke a blunt or two, nigga
It's lit, came in the game like a red nose pit
You got business in LA? I dead your shit
Shut video shoots down, turn airplanes around
Knowledge in belly anonymous rounds
Tryna host AOD and niggas lying you down
Of course the wolves can smell when vagina in town
Turn these niggas inside out like Killa Cam back
Intercepted at the airport, nigga the Rams back
Flying Spur, top missing like Ginobili
Grill all gold, that's my motherfucking whoadie
Love when niggas act like they don't know me
'Til I start shooting, remind 'em of the old Kobe
S'life
However do you want me? However do you need me?
(Whenever you want it, however you want it)
However do you want me? However do you need me?
(Whenever you want it, however you want it)

What's going down?
However do you want me?
Nigga, I'm my own Suge, report to nobody
Give these niggas awards and they still nobodies
I don't go to the Grammys, nigga I bag those
Fuck the BET awards, I done had those
Fuck a freestyle, nigga this a cash flow
Young Jay and I ain't never had a Jaz-O
Ask Kanye "who the real asshole?"
Cuban links smoking a Cuban, Fidel Castro
Feet up at Mastero's, table full of models
I'mma fuck 'em all, right hand on the Bible
Head game crazy, mommy suicidal
Rubbing on my dick while she download Tidal
This the life of Pablo mixed with Mercielagos
A product of gin and juice inside of my baby bottle
Said this the life of Pablo mixed with Mercielagos
No more parties in LA or Chicago
Whenever you want it, however you want it
Whenever you want it, however you want it
I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side
Staying alive was no jive
Had secondhands, mom's bounced on old man
So then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth, yo, rocking the gold tooth, 'Lo goose
Only way I be gettin' the G off was drug loot
And let's start it like this son
Rolling with this one and that one
(Red Wallabies) Buzzing with my Killa Beez
Chronic had my eyes chinky like Compton was the Philippines
Junior prom, red suit, Tasha in that limousine
Tryna suck the head off my dick like a guillotine
Came in her mouth, then gave her some Listerine
Put a condom on and let her grind it like a centipede
(Cash rules everything around me)
Before Dre found me, before my city crowned me
Bummy lil nigga, pussy niggas used to clown me
Had to wear my brother's clothes, them shits used to drown me
6 years passed now I'm banging in the county
Niggas that used to talk shit won't even come around me
Reciting Method Man while my celly just sit there
Niggas know I been on the Wu before Ric Flair
Came home through the hood, GX shining
Now these bitches think I'm Lex Diamonds
Nigga I grew up on Wu-Tang
Nigga I grew up on Wu-Tang
(Cash rules everything around me)
(Cash rules everything around me)
I grew up on Wu-Tang, dope had my shoe game Liu Kang
Jordan 12's sick as hell, Michael Jordan flu game
Glass jar, Pyrex, obsessed with the blue flame
Lexus coupe, rubbing on them titties boy, 2 Chainz
Top of the food chain, niggas wanna kill me
'Cause I turned into the plug, I'm where the chronic and the pills be
RZA with the rings, Ol' Dirty with the stainless
Five .38 revolvers, thirty-six chambers
Killah like Ghostface, as the Rollie rotate
Daytons on the S-Class equipped with the floor safe
And we had the stash spots with them red and blue tops
Chronic in the GLAAD lock, the dope spot padlocked
In the living room bagging shit up watching Matlock
Black Glock, crack rock bundled in my black socks
And my mama working late, skinny nigga serving weight
Let the chronic circulate the Purple Tape
Mama told me to stay away from them niggas
Mama told me she had a K for them niggas
Mama told me she go to pay for them niggas
But my grandmother told me that she would pray for them niggas
They just young black and ignorant lusting over models and them Benjamins
Got the game twisted (like what?) licorice
When I was rocking lottos moving packs up on McDonalds
She was looking for me, pulled up in that old El Dorado
I was running around with Chase, chasing new black wheels
Why would I do that still? That's what got 2Pac killed
But I use that still 'cause I won't do that deal
Screw the muzzle in potatoes of that new Mac Mill
What did I learn? Nothing, my papa smoking sure and bluffin'
Beating on my moms like her head was a percussion
Tat-tat my four five knocking on your window
She said there would be days like this
Pharrell, drop the instrumental
Yes sir
[Chorus: x2]
I know I must go and I don't know my way
Still somehow I know I'll end up where we all came from
(From my mama's womb)
Crack a Swisher, crack the fifther
Hennessy pouring like Niagara Falls
Used to watch Magic, he showed me how to ball
Mom's working late night, to get a plate right
Had some older brothers, all we did was smoke and play-fight
Wish I could go back to them days 'cause streets don't play right
Some niggas hard, other niggas was the Kid 'N' Play type
But that didn't stop me from pretending I was Apollo from Rocky
Working on my dip-game, now nobody wanna box me
Pick and choose, stick and move
So many dudes ended up with sleeping bags on late-night news
But not my mama's son, going around the hood for serving customers
She yapping in my ear, but it's louder than the muffler
What I didn't listen to, I wish I would've trusted her
Wish I had a shovel, be digging both of my brothers up
Like, "Here hug em ma, one last time"
Put a chain on both of them niggas, they get one last shine
[Chorus]
Put your block down, recognize a king 'cause it's my town
Word to my mother you can throw up your rock now
Got off the beef shit 'cause I ain't tryna see my mama in all-black
Right there, crying over hard facts
Now she gotta turn in all her cars and get her house back
Never, she carried me for nine months so she can have whatever
Clever, she taught me how to shoot Berettas, told me that I'd be a king
So R.I.P. to Coretta, if you don't understand that
Then refer to my letter, while I sprinkle
Niggas with platinum, from my last album
Got the check, so I signed on the X like Malcolm
Riding through the hood, you hating niggas like, "How come?"
That niggas Game got it, heard he selling talcum
Either way, playboy, check it, this is the outcome
You might not like it, but my mama psychic
Why you niggas twisted like the top of a sidekick?
[Chorus]
[Intro]
(?)
[Verse 1]
Six in the morning, police at my door
Woulda seen them niggas coming but the cameras is broke
Aunt in the kitchen cooking up for a week
And my lil homie Pooh on my mama couch sleep
We cooking base, we cooking base
We cooking base, we cooking base
50 grams on the table, a key in the couch tucked
And it's time to break it down cause everything getting flushed
Looking out the window tryna find a way out
Seen the SWAT team creeping on the side of the house
They threw a canister through the window, it shattered the glass
So I went into the closet and pulled out my gas mask
[Hook]
It's game for days, it's game for days
It's game for days, it's game for days
It's game for days, it's game for days
And I die before I go back to jail, tell them niggas this is
Bompton, Bompton, Bompton, Bompton
Bompton, Bompton, Bompton, Bompton
It's game for days, it's game for days
It's game for days, it's game for days
It's game for days, it's game for days
[Verse 2]
Nigga fuck the cops
They're supposed to have my house surrounded but it's not
So I'm hopping over the back gate with my Glock
Crossing Wilmington with 1500 in my sock
Look across the street, they running in and out my spot
Aunt on the curb in cuffs
And Pooh don't know what's going on cause he just woke up
Till my Cincinnati fitted walked in and out the store
Ain't find no drugs or guns so they let my niggas go
We supreme, we mix that Sprite with that Promethazine
Hop in that Cutlass, hit the switch and flee the scene
Euro coming up the block looking like a mobster
Chucking up P's when we riding through
[Hook]
Bompton, Bompton, Bompton, Bompton
Bompton, Bompton, Bompton, Bompton
[Verse 3]
Riding down Alameda, everything was street
Until we stopped at a light, and ran into the grapes
My heart beating like a 15" with bass
Cause I reached for my strap and it wasn't on my waist
I'm a fool
What kind of nigga go to work without his tools?
And you often watch wearing red like it's blue
It's usually on sight with the crips
My guns stuck between the seats and them niggas ain't trip
Bust a left on Imperial, sliding on gold rims
Empty the guts out the swisher then hop on the 110
Look around, I don't see one black and white
So we rolled the windows up and hotboxed at the light, yeah
[Hook]
It's game for days, it's game for days
It's game for days, it's game for days
It's game for days, it's game for days
Watch Kobe score 60 on the Jazz, now we heading back to
Bompton, Bompton, Bompton, Bompton
Bompton, Bompton, Bompton, Bompton
It's game for days, it's game for days
It's game for days, it's game for days
It's game for days, it's game for days
[Outro]
Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head, ha-ha-ha-ha
Seven forty-six, wake up, hand on my dick
Lakers lost by thirty last night, I'm talking shit
Roll up a Backwood, killer in my spliff
Reading GQ magazine while I take a shit
Walk back to my room, wake up this bitch
Kickin' her out, dick in her mouth, that Compton shit, boy
I'm on that monster shit, boy
Chopper out the trunk, on some Compton shit, boy
I remember flipping dimes and shit
Putting five to them planes, that La Bamba shit
Dr. Dre ain't got time for this, he wearing Beats
I got my ear to the ground, lil' nigga, I'm in these streets like
Streetlights and lead pipes, up in the projects
We gon' make it out but this shit is a slow process
Lean right, keep heat tight, don't ever digest
Hollow tips where your mind rest, you forgot
They don't make niggas like me (they don't make niggas like me, they don't make niggas like me)
Nah, they don't make niggas like me (they don't make niggas like me, they don't make niggas like me)
They don't make niggas like me (they don't make niggas like me, they don't make niggas like me)
They don't make niggas like me (they don't make niggas like me, they don't make niggas like me)
Wassup
I'm that nigga that sold packs by the bungalows
Animal out here, my niggas in the jungles know
I'm cold like one below in Green Bay
Had the water on the block, to the fiends I was a stingray
I had a Z before I seen Jay
I had the West, I used to sling yay
But sometimes when tables turn like a DJ
Had them rocks and them bands like Green Day
I used to listen to, project pepto straps and sell crack
Used to smoke that Bobby Brown, fuck rats and sit back
On my forte, was more yay, my enemies got gift-wrapped
The two nicks in two days, got new fits and new Js
Thankful for my two Ks, my vision clear as Blu-ray
Kill your ass today, knock the glue off your toupÃ©e
My guns like "hi", leave that shy shit to Lupe
Then chop the top off the coupe, doomsday
They don't make niggas like me (they don't make niggas like me, they don't make niggas like me)
Nah, they don't make niggas like me (they don't make niggas like me, they don't make niggas like me)
They don't make niggas like me (they don't make niggas like me, they don't make niggas like me)
They don't make niggas like me (they don't make niggas like me, they don't make niggas like me)
Cook crack nigga
Ay who got all these niggas walking around
With all this motherfuckin' air in they chest?
Oh, you pumpin' your motherfucking self up, huh?
You know I'm with the bullshit, ay
You know I'm with the bullshit
Niggas know I'm with the bullshit
You know I'm with the bullshit
Pull up, park the Camaro like an arrow
Only fuck with Snoop, nigga fuck your cousin Harold
Plus I got the barrel on tuck, nigga what
First nigga jump up, first nigga fucked up
I'm with the bullshit, Jimmy Butler in the cutlass
Hop out, get yo ass beaten, no mustard
Hood full of killers, Cedar Block, no busters
Say we gon' do it, but we ain't, don't trust us
Get your ass robbed out here
By a nigga name Rob out here with no job out here
We with the bullshit, Burgundy sob out here
Get smoked if ever say slob out here
Nigga this Piru, I'm advertising like a commercial
Hand me your hood pass, pat you down then murk you

Blood this ain't no motherfuckin' movie
You know I'm with the bullshit, ay
You know I'm with the bullshit
Niggas know I'm with the bullshit
You know I'm with the bullshit
Forty days, forty nights
If I ever lose a muthafuckin' fight
You in the pen', say good night
Get your ass strangled with the motherfuckin' kite
I am with the bullshit, save them motherfuckin' tears
You bunk down with the nigga that ain't had pussy in years
He with the bullshit, fuck you gon' go?
Nigga where the fuck you gon' go when he made you his hoe
Now you switchin' in the pen
Through the glass talking to your mama, bitchin in the pen'
Oh you snitchin' in the pen?
Your lawyer stuck you on the pen', nigga just stick you in the pen' (oh)
My nigga Reek doing thirty
And I got gun that he did murder with, it's still dirty
And I heard from a little birdy, niggas wanna problems
Jump in my Impala, skrrt!
You know I'm with the bullshit, ay
You know I'm with the bullshit
Niggas know I'm with the bullshit
You know I'm with the bullshit
Forty ounces ain't the only thing poppin'
'Round here we get it clockin' when the things start knockin'
Low lows ain't the only thing droppin'
Bodies hit the ground, tires screeching niggas yell "compton"
Like oh, oh
Them niggas hoppin' out of coupÃ©s, coupÃ©s
Fuck you thought nigga they tryna' overuse the shotty
Shit I'm tryna' hit the news with the shotty
I am from where the niggas say "what'd up cuh?"
You can get your ass wet up by "one blood?"
And I bet they just saw el chapo
And you can get your noodles spilled right up in your taco
And you can get your taco turnt into some nachos
All over cheese my nigga
What's beef my nigga ridin' by slow mo
Bullet holes in caine and sharif my nigga
Fuck peace my nigga 'cause every time we try that
We get smoked by police my nigga
I am bringing sheets my nigga
Went from being skinny and gettin' jacked for my penny's to a beast my nigga
Forty ounces ain't the only thing poppin'
'Round here we get it clockin' when the things start knockin'
Low lows ain't the only thing droppin'
Bodies hit the ground, tires screeching niggas yell "compton"
Like ooh, ooh
Them niggas hoppin' out of coupÃ©s, coupÃ©s
Fuck you thought nigga they tryna' overuse the shotty
Shit I'm tryna' hit the news with the shotty
I want the zooms zooms and wam wams, bricks in the trans am
Shooters on first, second and third, that's a grand slam
These rap niggas fruit loops; toucan sam
When I say so, bloods rush like a handstand
And ain't with that old death row shit
Been bangin' since nineteen-four, I ain't never did no hoe shit
Type of nigga I am, empty out the whole clip
Call my yg's and have em' run through your whole shit
Who was before kendrick, who was before nip?
Middle of the slauson, did my shit fighting four crips
You win some and you lose some nigga
You break knuckles and you bruise some nigga, what?

[Game - Verse 1]
Sometimes I have f-cked up dreams
Wake up in cold sweats, can't sleep,
Hit the kitchen for some Moet
I get drunk, but I ain't never smoke no wet
Been on tour 3 months and I aint had no sex
Been meditating, exercising my mental bowflex
Michael Jackson dead, which one of us 'bout to go next
Me, Mary J, Robin Thicke or Britney Spears
Nigga I ain't afraid to die, tell the devil I'm right here
Hoe, I can take the strings out of these Nike airs
Tie it round the ceiling fan and end it right here
Kick the ladder cause I climbed that twice
Hate it or love it, I'm one blood nigga, it's my life
And I can die if I want to, and mama you can cry if you want to
Just tell my sons the truth and as the maggots eat away at my flesh
Let this iced out cross, walk through the bones in my chest
[Chorus]
I can try my way (I'm lost)
I can't find my way (lost)
I can't find my way (I'm lost)
I can't find my way (lost)
I can't find way...
[Game - Verse 2]
If I tell the story you gotta keep it between us,
Only other niggas that know are Spliff Star and Buss
I call Buss when I need a shoulder
And I don't always listen so he call me back and say "I told you"
But anyway, my paps is a Peadophile, how you stick your 28 year old d-ck in your child
And now how it feel to be 52 and have a son that's a millionaire, and he don't f*ck with you, daddy!
She was only in the six grade, the day I heard her scream, I should have hit you with the switch blade
Then she ran but I ain't know which way, she ended up in Vegas doing everything her pimp say
I've seen her one Christmas with a black guy, I took her to the store and bought her shades with my last five,
My little sister is a prostitute, and I'ma tell you what I'm about to do.
Go get her cause she... (lost)
[Chorus]
She can't find her way
She can't find her way
She can't find her way
She can't find her way
She can't find her way
[Game - Verse 3]
Thats all I'm thinking on this Grey hound
Usually I'll be in this seat with brids and a tre pound
But this time I riding for family
Like Khaled did for Ross, they hold it down in Miami
On my way to Michigan, not to see D12
I'm knocking on every door, "have you seen this female?"
Here's a picture of my pretty baby sister
Here go one when she was ten and this one our last Christmas
Low light skinned girl, long curly black hair, sorry for wasting time, I know you probably don't care,
Feel like I walk longer than just 8 miles
Ran into a borded up BMF safe house
Made me think about all the time I spent with Meech makin' it rain in Magic city
When life was a Georgia peach
Now life is a rotton apple
Run faster than New York
You see my sister call me 'cause life is too short to get (lost)
[Chorus]
She can't find her way
She can't find her way
She can't find her way
She can't find her way
She can't find her way
I'm at the house bout to roll this kush up
I can get a call at any minute, so I'm just doing push-ups
Waiting on what seems to be forever
I burned a hole in my Polo sweater 'cause I was nervous
But hat's how crazy birth is, loading up this Beretta
'Cause this time I'm having a baby girl
So it's whatever, whenever whatever
You my willow and it's my will to make this last forever
First thing I'ma tell her, daddy's your umbrella
Give her the glass slipper Cali, you my Cinderella
Gotta be a dream, hold up, that's your middle name
Both your brothers big now, so baby you my little Game
Who gon' be the Godfather? Swizz? Lil Wayne?
Hey y'all smoke too much but got Cali tatted on his veins
And I just got a text from your mama
Saying the water burst, I guess it's time for my comma
You walk through the door, she on the ground crying
She don't wanna get up, you had a baby right here
I ain't cleaning that shit up
I finally got her out the house, now we on the elevator
She screaming, her left the car seat, but I'ma tell her later
Forget the car seat, man, I'm hella-faded
She like "I know you ain't high!"
Shit, "I'm celebrating"
Now we in the car, she won't put on her seat belt
Screaming at the top of her lungs,"God, I need help!"
Weaving through traffic, minutes between contractions
Close your eyes right now, and you can see it happening
Imagine she pulling on me "Stop I'm about to crash, shit!"
Butterflies in my stomach, heart beating fast as shit
Every time I have a kid, it's like the first time
Kids the best, but they be coming at the worst times
Now we here, Tiff get in the wheelchair
Them butterflies still here, am I happy? Hell yeah
I parked the car, now I'm running through the halls lost
Trying to figure out which one of these rooms is ours
Think, think damn one of the nurses stuck their head out
They gave her an epidural so I pulled the couch bed out
Took a nap, woke up, they almost got the head out
She grabbing on the rails, looking like she about to pass out
Told her to breathe, grab my phone and hit record
"Breathe, one, two, three, four, one more, two, three, four
"Push, c'mon T, push! God damn it, just push!"
Nurse Linda coaching her, Doctor Umbar pulling on shoulders
Giving me the notion to cut the umbilical cord
She out, eight pounds four ounces, Sam stop the beat
Hold up, I'm about to make an announcement,
"See, every time a child is born somebody leave the world
So I thank the woman who gave her life for my baby girl"
"Hey mars turn the beat down a little so I can share my experience"
Since Big ain't here, I'm about to do it for T'yanna
And put roses on the grave of Kanye's mama
This for all the lost girls locked up in the pen
All the girls that hold it down, getting beat on by they man
Respect women, I don't care if they a 2 or a 10
We don't beat on Kat Stacks, we just bring it to an end
And we don't wanna see Nicki fighting Lil Kim
There's missing women out there, we should focus on 'em
This song is dedicated to Natalie Holloway
I feel for her daddy so I wrote this on father's day
I know she gone, but she ain't far away
I just had a daughter, pass me that cigar 'Ye
I'm 'bout to tell a story, everybody parlay
Sit back listen while I kick it, the Compton Boulevard way
My daddy used to beat up on my mama all day
So I took my Chronic album and slept in the hallway
I learned this the hard way, when police came our way
My daddy had his act on like it never happened (Broadway)
Plus I was kinda scared to keep it real with you
Now my mama good, nigga she ain't gotta deal with ya
You want some money nigga? I ain't get a deal with ya
You ain't saying nothing, you like a still picture
You better thank God you still breathing air
Cause you coulda went out like your boy Steve McNair
Don't make the good girls go bad
Don't make the good girls go bad
You don't really love her
Please don't do it
Good evening, I'm in Chicago at the Elysian
With some girls that say they models but umm, I don't believe 'em
Who's still getting tested?
Where's all the women that still remember who they slept with?
Where's all the girls too busy studying to make the guest list?
But when you do go out, you still working what you was blessed with
Do it girl, I'll be the king to your Queen Latifah
I love your ass like Milhouse loved Lisa
I love your ass like the Ninja Turtles love pizza
Ironically enough, you something I want a piece of, you got it girl
This song remind me of Cat from Philly, a girl I used to love
Until she started acting silly, her heart's a little chilly
She a little too carefree in 10 years
Who's paying for all that therapy? Umm, nigga not me
I'm probably not the man you take me for
But I bet I could be if you make me yours
Most of the shit I say is true
When I'm done with bad bitches, know I'm coming straight to you good girl
Don't make the good girls go bad
Don't make the good girls go bad
You don't really love her
Please don't do it
Drizzy, I'm sitting here watching Basketball Wives
Like, "uhh, them is basketball wives?"
Only cute one, Gloria, that's my nigga Matt Barnes' chick
Can't swim in that poon fool, that's a crucial conflict
Never sleep with the wife of niggas you eat with
And never buy a chick a bag on the first date
I pop a bottle with her on her birthday and tell her ass "get on!"
Disrespect my chick, that type of shit'll get you spit on
I don't hit on girls, I just hit on girls
Like "hey lil mama, come in Game and Drizzy's world"
Get busy girl, drink that rosÃ© 'till you're dizzy girl
She walking around the club all lost, like where is he girl?
He on the top of the charts, next to Beyonce
Right under Kanye, so let the Don spray
That's your girl? nigga go on and make her cry
Soon as you do, I'm pulling up in that Porsche like "let's ride"
Don't make the good girls go bad
Don't make the good girls go bad
You don't really love her
Please don't do it
Word on the news stand, Alicia got herself a man
And thats my nigga Swizzy, know you see Game and Drizzy
Surrounded by them diamonds, I'mma cold mackin
Nigga its a cold climate, don't ask me where the crime went
Just tell me where them dimes went
So I can get em fitted, let em beat a bridesmaid at the wedding for my niggas
Yeah I'm married to the game
And she married to my chain, watching Boyz n The Hood
Lets take a drive down memory lane
I was born in the cross hairs without a pot to piss in
Where niggas get smoked over Jordans and their Pippens
Welcome to California, nah, it ain't cold as New York
But life is a bitch out here, word to Too Short
Whack was a shooter so we called him Tony Kukoc
Gang banging had us addicted like it was new ports
Whoever thought that it would spread like petroleum
Now BP connect got us praying to them holy men
Just had a daughter homie, named her Katrina
If I raise her right, then maybe she can take over FEMA
Spike Lee in New Orleans shooting documentaries
And Game still in Cali eating off the documentary
Take em to the symmetry I mean the cemetery
Where everybody boxed in, refrigerator Perry
And everybody little fuck up, they blame it on Barack
'Cause he's just like T.I. born in the trap
And everybody little fuck up, they blame it on Barack
'Cause he's just like Gucci, born in the trap
And everybody little fuck up, they blame it on Barack
'Cause he's just like Jeezy, born in the trap
And every little fuck up, my gun she go, "crack"
'Cause I'm just like Outkast, born in the trap
So what's going on with you faggots?
And what you gonna do when your swagger no longer matters?
And your bitch ain't the baddest 'cause she in her mid-40s
And your phantom played out so you hating on the shorties
'Cause they running around like they was your age and you was your age
Fucking bitches raw 'cause now the world ain't got no AIDS
Yeah, 2050 all you niggas gold diggers
Sucked you dry left them hickeys on you niggas
I used to run around like you, run the town like you
Walk my red nose and clown like you, but it got old like Betty White
This rap shit real deep like Barry White
Reminiscing on the days I used to carry white
Walking though them Crip hoods in the Cherry Nikes
Now I lead a married life, walking in the house, to them home-cooked meals
Joint American Express accounts and less dollar bills
Niggas still got their hands out, begging for a stack
Just like Goodie Mob, I was born in the trap
Niggas still got their hands out, begging for a stack
But just like Luda, I was born in the trap
Niggas still got their hands out, begging for a stack
But like Soulja Boy, I was born in the trap
Broke ass niggas still begging for a stack
Take 'em to Shawty Lo, nigga, learn how to trap
Shit deeper than The Roots band
Fifteens drumming, questlove in the coupe fam
Riding through Pittsburgh, Wiz got the Steelers
Born by the jungle so I came with gorillas
Since niggas dropping more dimes than we fuckin'
We out the hood, tryna get money like Pete Touchin
Splitting backboards just to get our weed stuffed in
The crack we cookin, we don't need ovens
We need something to put in the mouth of our kids
Instead of copping chains, lets fly to Chile and dig
Go to Haiti and feed to the Bahamas and breathe
On the way back, to my nigga Sean from Belize, you know
Sometimes I feel like this rap shit is heaven sent
Then I get a high, feel like it's irrelevant
So I'm about to pop the trunk like an elephant
And campaign with Wyclef while he run for president
I'm 'bout to pop the trunk like an elephant
And campaign with Wyclef while he run for president
Told you I was gonna kill this shit, Primo
You know rockin' with the best
[Jim Jones]
Who's in charge? I'm asking y'all
Somebody better answer before I blast at y'all
Live life just as fast as y'all
But you little niggas know that my cash is tall
New York like Stoudemire
You think your hot, well I'm on fire
The money wash up and I'm tryna dry it
If a new car drops, then I'm tryna buy it
Cam front, kinda tired
Had a bitch last night, left her in the higher
At the party, music loud
(?) move the crowd
Then we Clinton Spark 'em
Damn right, let my niggas chalk 'em
All my dogs bite, we gon do the barking
And the money speak loud, we gon do the talking
And what you do with the bread
U went to the ghetto and tell 'em Su Woo bred
And I'm sorry to say, lift the back now home boy the 'rari today
Such a horrible day
(?) Bouquet
Married to the game, I don't need no bouqeut
Just a new whip and it got her to pay
So I tell 'em touche
Go nigga, Go
Rozay mo'
Just got started, tell 'em ten mo'
With a bitch on my side with some hips like woah
[Chorus]
Lemme see you hit the floor (c'mon)
I know that your with it
Till ya body sore
Girl you know you can get it
I'm gonna play for you tonight like it's your birthday
Tonight I'm gonna be you're favorite DJ
Say Go, Go, Say Go DJ
Say Go, Go, Say Go DJ
Say Go, Go, Say Go DJ
Tonight I'm gonna be your favorite DJ
[Bun B]
Lights is flashing, cameras filming
soon as we walked up in the building
Bopers fainting, haters kneeling
I smell like money, look like a trillionaire
and I really don't care how you feeling
Big-faced hundred dollar bills I'm peeling
Bottles stacked up to the ceiling
and I just can't explain the feeling
Fellas, put your grands up
Ladies, put your hands up
We sipping Jimmy Neutron, player, and I can barely stand up
R.I.P. to the Pimp, you know I rep for UGK
Get 4 million with Clinton Sparks, your favorite DJ
[Chorus]
Lemme see you hit the floor (c'mon)
I know that your with it
Till ya body sore
Girl you know you can get it

Tonight I'm gonna be your favorite DJ
[Game]
Hit 'em with the punchline, hit 'em with the bass
Blowing that orange kush all in my face
Glock on my hip, nigga, murder was the case
Any nigga want drama, boy, I hit 'em with the 'K
Nigga act cool, nigga, hit 'em with a J
Swim in that pool, Pat and Ryan all day
Nigga need work, I got birds in the safe
Ski mask in the cut hand, keys to the Maybach
Where you lay at, bitch, I scope I never miss where I spray at
Underground King, nigga, UGK that
You should try crack all night, all day that
Tell me where the weight at
ZipLock baggies all in the trunk
Going through the zone blowing that purple stunk
Its the critics, get it?
(?) only got straight A's in physics
Dope boy business, Dope boy flashy
Chains on my neck, elbows still ashy
Hood nigga for real
Ask my nigga Pharrell
Turning my fingers on, the boy is the raw deal
Chicks all dimes, the motto is cash peels
Each one of them off down in Louis Vuitton heels
Tell 'em muthafuckas that the legend is real
Sleep next to a dime that I wake up to a meal
House on the hills
Where Hurricane lay his head at
Anywhere in the U.S., that's where I get my bread at
Nigga play the 9 by my waist, where the lead at?
Anywhere that I shoot, same spot nigga dig that?
Yellow take nigga
Clinton Sparks on the California quake nigga
When the light on, quick to kill a fake nigga
Cash Money in my pocket like the Drake nigga (nigga)
[Chorus]
Lemme see you hit the floor (c'mon)
I know that your with it
Till ya body sore
Girl you know you can get it
I'm gonna play for you tonight like it's your birthday
Tonight I'm gonna be you're favorite DJ
Say Go, Go, Say Go DJ
Say Go, Go, Say Go DJ
Say Go, Go, Say Go DJ
In Compton, you either a blood or a crip
Nigga ain't no one in between
Shit was a hard decision for him to make, cause both his parents was crips
His Uncle Greg was a crip, he died when he was 5
His brother Jevon, he got murdered when he was just 13
After that he decided that being a crip just wasn't for him
So he ran across the tracks until everything turned red
And never looked back
"You know we got em
Forty fives, machine guns, heavy artillery
We got those grenades on your ass, nigga
Boss, Black Wall Street
I'm in that bulletproof Maybach nigga (Teflon Don)"
Nigga talking like a G but walking like a broad
I pull up at the light, pineapple in your car
Nigga I shatter lives, my music camouflage
I court killers at the center of my synagogue
Torch in hand, extortion to the fortune five hundred
From the porches to the Porsche's with the wides on it
'Fore you snitches bitch, you better put your lives on it
Get you twisted by the ? with them wires on it
I get my money smoking spliffs like it's Friday
I'm sitting sideways like I'm in my driveway
My champagne kicks, my shit three wheels
You niggas six feet, we gettin' three meals
[Chorus]
They got jumped
Forty fives, machine guns, and heavy artillery
They got jumped
Forty fives, machine guns, and heavy artillery
Yeah I got two gun charges, two felonies, just got off probation
Today motherfucker, won't budge for no charge
Real nigga, I hold no grudge with no thugs
Come through spraying, bullets out the McLaren
They ain't meant for you, so move bitch, you hard of hearing?
I speed off doing 90 with the Carter blaring
Bust shots in the Cavalier like I ball with Baron
Yeah I Blake Griff niggas, make stiff niggas
Eminem wasn't Dr. Dre's only sick nigga
Insane in the membrane like Soul Assassins
Twelve gauge stop a nigga heart like a bowl of Aspirin
I hold automatics, let your man hold the casket
Murder game cold as Aspen, body found in the trash bin
First forty-eight, they don't find me, case closed
Like a rehabilitation spot in Bobby Brown nose
Take em back to Boyz in da Hood when I pull the pump out
Something like C-Murder on Worldstar when I dump out
[Chorus]
Ain't nothing changed but them bullets in my clip
I still pull it, still bully niggas on the strip
Beef, I cook it fully with the fifth
And I ain't got no pets, I put a bullet in ya bitch
A nigga with a gun in his hand who won't bust it?
Like a bitch with a dick in her hand who won't suck it
This is the art of war, you niggas just drawing
Anything I target on is dearly departed, gone
Drive by or walk up on, I just stop, breathe, aim cock squeeze
Silencer on the Glock, infrared beam
So your block up on machines while the pussies run and scream
[Chorus: x3]
[Chorus]
Rolling up a swisha banging Nate Dogg
Pulling on this 8ball contemplating suicide
(Hold Up)
Tears in my eyes, sippin on this goose gettin' loose
I don't know what else to do, so I'm sittin' here
Rolling up a swisha banging Nate Dogg
Pulling on this 8ball contemplating suicide
(Hold Up)
Tryna smoke the pain away
Hand on the dessert
All dogs go to heaven
Til then (smoke weed everyday)
[Game]
Aftermath studio, 2005
It was live, it was Snoop, it was Nate, it was I
It was Dre, It was Daz and Kurupt, we was high
One of my favourite memories
Them n-ggas like kin to me
When they move, I move
We like a centipede
Back when Dre was in his drop like Kennedy
I was banging Regulate, round the hood regulating
In and out of county jail when crips and bloods were segregating
And just like y'all, I used to love tha Dogg Pound
10 years later we here, laying Nate Dogg down
Damn, he was only 41 so I'mma get high and just drink til this 40 done
But I really wanna cry, shit I really wonder why good n-ggas gotta die
If we living under God
Maybe he living in the sky and I couldn't bring him back if I tried
So we just rolling up a swisha
[Chorus]
[Game Verse 2]
Allstar weekend, I seen Warren G with no Nate Dogg
Thats like MJG with no 8Ball
I don't wanna see that R.I.P tatt
LBCPT that, we that coast where the DPG at!
Eazy-E that, tell me where the weed at?
You see that, all red P hat
Where Pac used to eat at
Hoes in different area codes, better believe that
Can you believe this where they killed BIG at
Now he at where N-A-T-E D O double G at
Cause that's where all dogs go because of you we all blow
Now when I need a hook, who I'm gonna call for
I sample your old shit, i don't know these new n-ggas
Bout to roll an ounce of this kush, I need a few swishas
And the game will never be the same without him
I'm just mad he aint here to hop ont he R.E.D album
[Chorus]
[Game - Verse 3]
I'm in the crib, Dre beats on, banging Lay Low
Kush to the dome, stacking kills on his halo
Tryna get my mind what it is, but it is what it is
Everybody raise ya lighters when I say so
Shed tear, thats for Nate bro
Cali will never be the smae, Cube and Dre know
I hold the West Coast down, thats why he signed me
And Nate came with hooks better than Kareem and Ali
I'm blowing smoke up in the wind
Kinda hard to concentrate when you sitting here focused on the end
Today a child is born, tomorrow he's a man
Next day he gone
Life cycle repeats itself again and again
Uncle's cousins and his friends
No-one escapes death or drives to heaven in a Benz
But one things for sure, everybody gotta go
When it's my turn I hope I never know
(Hold Up)

Buck Back On That Bullshit, He Even Got His Baby Momma Walkin With A Full Clip

I am one with the moon, the 54 platoon, where bean come and soon
Trade out of the ... along, only wind that blows in the winter, the placenta
The danger, the marijuana, keeps me lifting like the sting, the
So I ponder, Niki Bees or Bill Honners, the other day I've seen my mama
Dipping in my danger, I sad what are you doing?
She blamed Obama, presidential Rolexes, presidential sweets all night switchers
It's kinda like a picture with no paint, blank, like the mind of a dead man
And bitches are sweating me like Hellen Ireson's head bang
Drip after drip, I drop the phantom top, no Mariah
But I can be fire my can is hot as a Californian summer on your ace and a Hummer
This is game spitting flames with Andre 3000 numbers
Love birds, love birds me and my rose phantom are
Love birds, love birds, me and my marijuana are
Love birds, love birds, me and the palm trees are love birds
Love birds, love birds, me and the Cadillac are
Love birds, love birds, me and the atl are
Love birds love birds, me and my microphone are love birds
I introduce the to your smelling, chronic bushes that are larger than African elephants
Relevant is my kush yours is not so stop pretending it's from a Californian spot
I am so high, it would take the white to snatch me out of the sky
I am flying and your career dying,
I should get my best kaky suit out of the closet and put the iron to it
Reminiscence back when I didn't have a kaky suit to cruise on
Kept it moving, now I brawl like Patrick Ewing, junior ask baby
Before he met me I was sicker than a tumor and I had a glock that do
Bullets like boomer, had niggers running faster they're running back
On a Oklahoma sooners, no sooner I said it I was sweated by my baby mama, the first one, drama
Love birds, love birds me and my rose phantom are
Love birds, love birds, me and my marijuana are
Love birds, love birds, me and the palm trees are love birds
Love birds, love birds, me and the Cadillac are
Love birds, love birds, me and the atl are
Love birds love birds, me and my microphone are love birds.

Mars
Blood gang kill 'em all, Odd Future Wolf Gang
Kidnap a vampire, drain all his fuckin' veins
Wolf gray Jordan's, use his intestines for the strings
Snatch up Rihanna and throw her in front of a fuckin' train
Sniff a fucking unemployment line of cocaine
Tie Lil' B up to a full tank of propane
Swag, now watch him cook
And just stand there and look
Have a bonfire with old Harry Potter books
Martians versus Goblins, goons versus the crooks
And since me and Tune had Viacom shook
I shoulda got a real-ass pirate to do the hook
Maybe Jack Sparrow maybe Peter Pan's nemesis
My power's limitless like Blanka on Sega Genesis
Superhero, mad that Marvel overlooked me
Cause Spiderman and Hulk straight pussy
Bitch I'm a mothafuckin' martian (Goddamn Goblin)
Bitch I'm a mothafuckin' martian (It's the goddamn Goblin)
Bitch I'm a mothafuckin' martian (I'mma goddamn Goblin)
Mothafuckin' martian (Goddamn Goblin)
We are not the same, I am a martian
A year ago, I was poor, somewhat
Now my future's brighter than Christopher's new haircut
Bruno Mars is still sucking dick and fucking male butts
In the same closet that Tyler Perry gets clothes from
Um, I suck? Where the fuckin' Ring Pops?
You got a better chance of getting a copy of Detox
Wolf Gang, we rock, crack rock and that shit was expected
Like Jayceon whenever he name-drops (Fuck you, Tyler)
Jesus, motherfucking Theresa
This nigga Game got Wolf Haley for this feature
My team is running shit like we have full-cleat Adidas
Getting chased by the polices on a full bred Cheetah
Bishop Eddie caught me tryna escape
Bag full of drag and a Nicki Minaj mixtape
Dragging all you fags to the back of the log cabin
Fall back like Lebron's hairline against the Mavericks (he lost)
Bitch I'm a mothafuckin' martian (Goddamn Goblin)
Bitch I'm a mothafuckin' martian (It's the goddamn Goblin)
Bitch I'm a mothafuckin' martian (I'mma goddamn Goblin)
Mothafuckin' martian (Goddamn Goblin)
We are not the same, I am a martian
I do 'cause lil' Tunechi always bless me
He killed me on my own track, so what? Not you
Fuck you, I spit like I had kids with Erykah Badu
I fucked her on the day of that naked video shoot
I was sucking that pussy like it was wonton soup
Then I hit Lebron's mom in bron-bron's coupe
With Delonte West taping, we had bon-bons too
And Cleveland cheerleaders, they had pom-poms too
So I smacked them bitches wearing Bishop Don Juan's suit
(Where was Snoop?) I don't know, probably doing what the Crips do
But when I'm with my uncle, fuck it! Then I'm a Crip too
And I will Crip Weezy, Crip Jones, and Crip you
Now I'm the Doggfather, walking with a Shih Tzu
Mad that DC comics overlooked me
Cause Captain America's straight pussy
Bitch I'm a mothafuckin' martian (Goddamn Goblin)
Bitch I'm a mothafuckin' martian (It's the goddamn Goblin)
Bitch I'm a mothafuckin' martian (I'mma goddamn Goblin)
Mothafuckin' martian (Goddamn Goblin)
We are not the same, I am a martian
I'm in this mothafucker doing what I wanna
Ten bottles, teb bitches, go with my persona
Pull up in that Enzo then I do donuts
I'm that cool, cashews, make 'em all go nuts
(Baby got ass, I need me a shot of that
Lil mama get gangsta for me, stuff it in your Prada bag)
That's right, she's got something that I wanna see
That's right, so if she leave, she fucking with me
That's life, twerk something, work something, hurt something
She wanna check, check this shit out like a verse coming
They rip their neck and run their mouth when they heard something
Dre dropped another one and fucked around and murdered something
Club filled with dead bodies
If not then you a zombie, I'm not gonna feel sorry
You pass out from it, get drunk, get blunted
Do what you wanna do, drug test on you
Lotta money when I talk
Big mills, big deals 'bout a hundred in a vault
Sit still, that real, lotta haters throw salt
They lost big Game give a fuck how you feel
I fear she just might just pop that pill
And feel on me all night till the tip spill
Tip scales with her waistline, sex with the bass line
She gon' fuck a snare drum one drink at a time
Blow right, hoes fight over my name
I got my dough right, hustle running all in my veins
It's forty days, forty nights if I'm making it rain
I reign supreme, a bottle and some bomb-ass weed and we good
If you got drugs in this motherfucker
Let me see your hands in the air
Narcotics in the club and the ladies love us
So let's get high off something
High of something, high of something
'til your mothafucking brain don't function
High of something, high of something
Fireworks when I spark, yellow tape
Lotta chalk thought you said you a boss
Big deal, bitch chill, pulling out that black card
Showin' off big spendin', letting alcohol spill
I feel she might just get too faded
X-rated that's what I like glad that you made it
To this ceremony at hand, take a sip lets plan
For the future, introduce you to Snoop get you right and
May I, kick a little something for G's and
Make a few ends as I breeze through?
The shit on my hip is a fucking preview
And guess what it lead to
If you got drugs in this motherfucker
Let me see your hands in the air
Narcotics in the club and the ladies love us
So let's get high off something
High of something, high of something
'til your mothafucking brain don't function
High of something, high of something
Yeah DJ Khalil lets go
Money, for the money [Repeat: x2]
[Verse 1]
Kanye told me that Jesus walks in '04
But I grew up around impalas and drug lords
Welcome to Los Angeles palm trees and drug stores
All we know is rocks and presidents like Mount Rushmore
Fuck the police they hop out and bust doors
I ain't goin' back to jail nigga that what I flush for
My money or my glock who do I trust more?
I don't know it's probably the one that I touch more
Guess it's the green cause paper motivate niggas
And my Rolex races cause it hate niggas
I use to only sell 8s like that Laker nigga
Now I'm movin' 24s like I play at the staples center
You might miss the game so nigga don't blink
My phantom stand out like Frank Lucas mink
So go ahead and think like Frank Lucas think
Somebody'll find your brains on the fuckin' kitchen sink about
[Chorus]
(Money)
Dead presidents, Big paper
(For the Money)
Benjamins, Skyscrapers, My niggas get
(Money)
My Bitches get
(Money)
Like the strippers get
From the block to the club I make it rain
(Money)
In California niggas die
(For the Money)
From the south to new york the bullets fly for the

Don't stop gettin'
(Money)
It don't matter where you from if you hustle motherfucker keep gettin' that
(Money)
[Verse 2]
Yeah Yeah
I get it that baby and slim cash money
All the jewelry on your whole crew that's my tax money
That Pablo Escobar crack money
That Lebron first nike contract money
That make it rain all my niggas throw a stack money
Stack it to the ceiling then call it Shaq money
That walk in the club, straight to the back money
Flavor of love delicious sittin' on my lap money
That rat money niggas get clapped money
Air force ones don't bend when I track money
Oh I'm rich like porter,
Havin' Alpo nightmares whippin' that border
Like McDonald's I was flippin' them orders
In that '02 Porsche truck weavin' through borders
I was through flippin' quarters When I made my first mil
I'm about a dollar 50 cent ain't real
[Chorus]
[Verse 3:]
Ooh Somebody tell snoop to pop open them briefcases
Order that patron tell em we want 3 cases
Fuck a black card you see these green faces
Look at my chest, now you've seen Vegas
Treat my money like the Crystal that we wastin'
Cause I'm a money machine I can re-make it
You a fool thinkin' that Freddy can see Jason
I been iced out like who the fuck need Jacob
The doc told me to be patient but I walked
Money like the white Howard next time he a free agent
I'm tryin' to make enough money so I can feed Asia
Have Asians in the kitchen cookin' in Louis V aprons
Word to Martha Stewart if I can park a Buick
Then I can flip a breech truck I got the heart to do it
Ball like the nigga Tony Parker do it
Speak no englis but Dinero I talk it fluent
[Chorus]
Get get get get g-get your paper boy [Repeat: x3]
Get get get get get get yea!
[Verse 1]
Red Rose, white cellar
No body, no casket, just blood spillin'
I aint a dead President but I love millions
They like "Game, where ya been?"
Yeh Blood chillin'
But not on no islands or no villa's
I've been lost in Compton with some drug dealers
I bought the Relapse loved it, hit the block hugged it
Em still spit crack the Aftermath oven is a muthaf-cker
But I aint seen it in years
Still survive like niggas threw me off the first tier
Still the most gutta, spit the most butta
My album's got more game than niggas at the Rucker
Who said I'll never go Platinum, never drop a Phantom
I park my shit at every strip club in Atlanta
Peace to my nigga T.I. for keeping a level head
Niggas I know flip after doing bids in the feds
So peace to C-Murder, come to my hood see murder
Aint a street in my city that you aint heard of
Bought up on the block, no love, black glocks, chrome slugs
and we all fit OJ's glove
And I'ma keep name droppin' long as my name poppin'
I mean long as the 'cane poppin'
All white knights, white Range, white pipes, crack in the concrete
Living the ?
I switch cars like superhead switch stars
You know why, cause I'm a crook bitch
F-ck ya book bitch
I live life like aint no money on my books bitch
I write the 16, you sing on the hook bitch
Dickin' em out, foreign cars I'm whippin' em out
Been gang bangin' since the first Pippen's was out
[Hook]
Me and my infra-red-red
Yeah thats right, my infra-red-red
All I need is my inferared-red
So f-ck the gun as long as its infrared-red
[Verse 2]
Same colour as the big apple
Its for my New York niggas thats in the hood clappin'
I done been through Brooklyn, Queens, BX and Harlem
Only chase money, never chase the stardom
Back to the law, thats how I became a target
Respected in every hood, bullet proof regardless
My glock got no feelings, hollows leave you heartless
Retaliation like tryna swim in the shark pit
Will I ever go at Nas, hell no
Will I ever go at Jay, I don't know
Stay hittin em with pot shots
Ridin' round tryna figure out who got Pac shot
Cause that got BIG shot, nigga's try to take out LA like big shot
Thats Chauncey Billups, for you niggas who don't understand it
You rap niggas like bitches, pitching underhanded
It's like throwin soft balls at Derek Jeter
I keep it hood, never put money in parking meters
like the f-ck the US government
I be on some over shit
28 inch rims rubber shit
Roll down the window f-ck with this
Roll up the endo, f-ck with this
Get it backward, yeah my shit that good
No more medical weed, back to chronic
No more Belvedere, Grey Goose and tonic
Keep a nigga f-cked up with a mind state like
Dont get ya nigga f-cked up, you know the crime rate up
[Hook]
I hit a nigga with the infra-red-red
Yeah thats right, the infra-red-red
All I need is the inferared-red
F-ck the gun as long as its infrared-red
[Verse 3]
And I can pop a nigga from a rooftop
Or hit 'em up close, let 'em know that I'm a f-cking killer
like Ghost-face, no trace for the jakes
When it come to the base in the kitchen I'm a chef like Rae
Nas was like U-God, I'm like "nah you God", right next to Rza as I'm lighting up the swisha
Pourin' out this liquor for my niggas that was bigger than the ditches that they living
That was put in by the triggers, they some niggas with some cold hearts
And you wonder why I walk around like my soul long, black hoody on
Writin' music like Mozart, Denzel, John Travolta, I play both parts
Drive this raggedy ass Bentely like its a go-kart
Aint been crazy since I learned how to throw dart
Run up on his muthaf-cking car, you a dead man
Nah, don't sweat it like Lebron James headband
Empty out the clip on anybody but Redman
I Blackout and you can Blackout 2
But I got night vision on this muthaf-ckin infra-red-red
[Hook]
Yeah thats right, the infra-red-red
All I need is the inferared-red
F-ck the gun as long as its infrared-red
[Outro]
Niggas know what the f-ck it is everytime we do this shit
We do this shit right, nigga
Yeah, shout out to Redman for no reason at all
Cool n Dre them my niggas, my brothers
Thats my family for life nigga's
His parents hustled
So he was left alone by himself a lot
So shit, he did whatever the fuck he wanted to do
When boys in the hood came out,
this little nigga rolled himself a joint
And watched the whole motherfucker by itself
His pops didn't give a fuck, but his mom found out?
Shit, she'd kill him and his dad
She didn't want him seeing,
being or getting caught up in no gangsta shit
So she never knew, until now
His moms and pops met in Compton
His pops was a Nutty Blocc Compton Crip
Moms was from South Central, she claimed Hoover
They had the lil nigga in 1979 at Martin Luther King hospital
And if you know anything about Killa King, you know this:
Being born there is just like dying there

Red rubies in my watch and my chain
Catch me in Wade County, I'm the king like James
Headed to the Game, Red Challenger today
Throwin' up red flags like I'm challenging the play
Tune, this shit retarded, I need a red helmet
And I'm all about my cake: red velvet
You can't help it, gotta see what I got
It's like Ripley's: Believe it or Not, you tell me
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I'm a Beast, believe that
Stop playing, I go hard, I go He-Man
Young Tune, break em off like a tree branch
Play with me, you in hot water: tea bag
All-black Maybach, call it decaff
And I just ordered your girlfriend some kneepads
Can you believe the unbelievable?
Bitch, I'm higher than Venus, Serena too
Yeah, Game, holla at ya: Soo Woo
Young Money bitch, we cold like two scoops
Life's a bitch and mine a diva
Point the biggest skeptic out I make 'em a believer
[Hook]
[Verse 3 - Baby]
Yeah, belee dat, a hundred on a marble floor
And everyday we on the grind tryna flip some more
Ya understand, acres on that new land
Suicide doors nigga, on that new Lamb'
P-p-p-ssy poppin' bullshit

Candy paint on the Harley making headlines
Belee dat

Belee dat, we ride every day homie
[Hook]
[My pain?]
It runs deep
Share it with me!
[Verse 1: 2Pac:]
They'll never take me alive
I'm gettin' high with my four-five
Cocked on these suckas, time to die
Even as a youngster causin' ruckus on the back of the bus
I was a fool all through high school kickin' up dust
But now I'm labelled as a trouble maker who can you blame?
Smokin' weed helped me take away the pain
So I'm hopeless
Rollin' down the freeway swervin, don't worry
I'm about to crash up on the curb, cause my visions blurry
Maybe if they tried to understand me
What should I do?
I had to feed my fuckin' family
What else could I do?
But be a thug
Out slangin' with the homies
Fuck hangin' with them phonies in the clubs
Got my mind on danger
Never been a stranger to homicide
My city's full of gang bangers and drive-bys
Why do we die at an early age?
He was so young
But still a victim of the 12 gauge
My memories of a corpse
Mind full of sick thoughts
And I ain't goin' back to court
So fuck what you thought
I'm drinkin' hennessey
Runnin from my enemies
Will I live to be 23?
There's so much pain
[Hook]
Everywhere I go
I see the darkness
Covering skys
Everywhere I go
Everywhere I go
Trouble seems to find me
Blood in my eyes
Everywhere I go
[Verse 2: Game]
What would you do, if you couldn't make it to the NBA?
What would you do, if you couldn't sing, like a Mary J?
What would you do, if you couldn't hit a white ball, like Tyga?
If you wanted to model, but you wasn't skinny like Tyra?
What if you wanted to be Eminem
But the closet thing to him, was a pack of M&M;'s?
You can be Eminem, and I got proof
Or you could be Obama, and bring back troops
Or you could be Osama, and tear off roofs
Or be Corporate America, and reject all youth
Be the fly on the woodgrain, inside my Coop
Or be the sole, inside my shoe
So you can see where I walk, you can see where I been
See my father raping my sister when she was just ten
9, 8, 7, 6, NASA take me away, life's a bitch
[Hook 2]
Everywhere I go
Trouble seems to find me
Blood in my eyes
Everywhere I go
[Verse 3: 2Pac]
They got me mobbin' like I'm
Loc'ed and ready to get my slug on
I load my clip and slip my motherfuckin' gloves on
I ain't scared to blast on these suckas if they test me
Trust, I got my Glock cocked playa if they press me
Bust on motherfuckers with a - paaassion
Better duck cause I ain't lookin when I'm - blaaastin'
I'm a nuttin, drinkin' Hennessey and gettin' high
On the lookout for my enemies
Don't wanna die
Tell me why cause this stress is gettin' major
A buck-fifty across the face with my razor
What can I do but be a thug until I'm dead and gone
Keep my brain on the game and stay head strong
These sorry bastards
Want to kill me in my sleep but will they can I see
And everyday it's just a struggle
Steady thuggin' on the streets
And I'll be ballin' loc
Don't let 'em make you worry
Keep swingin' at these suckas till you buried
I was born to raise hell
A nigga from the gutta
Word to mutha I'm tough
I'm kickin dust up
Ready to bust
I'm on the scene steady muggin' mean
Until they kill me
I'll be livin this life
I know you feel me
There's so much pain
[Hook] X2
Since Big ain't here, I'm about to do it for T'yanna
And put roses on the grave of Kanye's mama
This for all the lost girls locked up in the pen
All the girls that hold it down, getting beat on by they man
Respect women, I don't care if they a 2 or a 10
We don't beat on Kat Stacks, we just bring it to an end
And we don't wanna see Nicki fighting Lil Kim
There's missing women out there, we should focus on 'em
This song is dedicated to Natalie Holloway
I feel for her daddy so I wrote this on father's day
I know she gone, but she ain't far away
I just had a daughter, pass me that cigar 'Ye
I'm 'bout to tell a story, everybody parlay
Sit back listen while I kick it, the Compton Boulevard way
My daddy used to beat up on my mama all day
So I took my Chronic album and slept in the hallway
I learned this the hard way, when police came our way
My daddy had his act on like it never happened (Broadway)
Plus I was kinda scared to keep it real with you
Now my mama good, nigga she ain't gotta deal with ya
You want some money nigga? I ain't get a deal with ya
You ain't saying nothing, you like a still picture
You better thank God you still breathing air
Cause you coulda went out like your boy Steve McNair
Don't make the good girls go bad
Don't make the good girls go bad
You don't really love her
Please don't do it
Good evening, I'm in Chicago at the Elysian
With some girls that say they models but umm, I don't believe 'em
Who's still getting tested?
Where's all the women that still remember who they slept with?
Where's all the girls too busy studying to make the guest list?
But when you do go out, you still working what you was blessed with
Do it girl, I'll be the king to your Queen Latifah
I love your ass like Milhouse loved Lisa
I love your ass like the Ninja Turtles love pizza
Ironically enough, you something I want a piece of, you got it girl
This song remind me of Cat from Philly, a girl I used to love
Until she started acting silly, her heart's a little chilly
She a little too carefree in 10 years
Who's paying for all that therapy? Umm, nigga not me
I'm probably not the man you take me for
But I bet I could be if you make me yours
Most of the shit I say is true
When I'm done with bad bitches, know I'm coming straight to you good girl
Don't make the good girls go bad
Don't make the good girls go bad
You don't really love her
Please don't do it
Drizzy, I'm sitting here watching Basketball Wives
Like, "uhh, them is basketball wives?"
Only cute one, Gloria, that's my nigga Matt Barnes' chick
Can't swim in that poon fool, that's a crucial conflict
Never sleep with the wife of niggas you eat with
And never buy a chick a bag on the first date
I pop a bottle with her on her birthday and tell her ass "get on!"
Disrespect my chick, that type of shit'll get you spit on
I don't hit on girls, I just hit on girls
Like "hey lil mama, come in Game and Drizzy's world"
Get busy girl, drink that rosÃ© 'till you're dizzy girl
She walking around the club all lost, like where is he girl?
He on the top of the charts, next to Beyonce
Right under Kanye, so let the Don spray
That's your girl? nigga go on and make her cry
Soon as you do, I'm pulling up in that Porsche like "let's ride"
Don't make the good girls go bad
Don't make the good girls go bad
You don't really love her
Please don't do it
Word on the news stand, Alicia got herself a man
And thats my nigga Swizzy, know you see Game and Drizzy
Surrounded by them diamonds, I'mma cold mackin
Nigga its a cold climate, don't ask me where the crime went
Just tell me where them dimes went
So I can get em fitted, let em beat a bridesmaid at the wedding for my niggas
Yeah I'm married to the game
And she married to my chain, watching Boyz n The Hood
Lets take a drive down memory lane
[Verse 1:]
All you bitches is Nicki Minaj sons
So get her a trash bag so she can pick up her ones
She bend down I see her tracks
I make it rain she throw it back
And all this money keep me and pussy, no Kat Stacks
But I got racks on racks on racks
Pool side at the W, take a puff and relax
It's that millionaire lifestyle, Audemar iced out
Order more spades then hit 'em with that lifestyle
But these fakes hoes won't leave me alone
Fake bag, fake ass and she beggin' for patron
My credit making good, my money need a loan
And them heels you got on, pound sign
[Hook:]
Basic bitch
I got a bitch with me, she got a bitch with her
And I ain't talkin' 'bout no basic bitch
Beyonc, laced front on
Who you trying to front on? And stunt on?
You just a basic bitch, she got a fake Louie
Fake [?], fake booty
So she a basic bitch
At the club all weekend, she trying to get rich
But all I got is this dick for a basic bitch
[Verse 2:]
So knock it off with your knock-off
You give head to any nigga riding with his top off
You the type I'd knock off, forget I ever met you
Block you on Twitter, never BBM or text you
Lookin' for the next you, I just wanted to sex you
Hit you on the D-Low, I'm Cee-Lo, F You
Cause everytime I'm up in the club looking for hoes
Everything look good off a couple bottles of rose
Down low with your swag, stuntin' off of your toes
And paintin' a mental picture of you without all your clothes
Have you ever fucked a millionaire in the back on a rose?
With Amber Rose? I ain't talking 'bout no
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
I can tell by your avatar, you never had caviar
Your friends can't go, you can't go, you don't have a car
But that weave hanging down to your ass
Bitch ain't from Dallas, but she rooting for the Mav's
You a bandwagon ho fo sho'
You up in every video takin' off your clothes
I thought I told you that you wouldn't get far
Melissa forgets, [?] child's mad at how Honda Accord is
2012 Range, now look how times change
You bitches'll never get a ring, LeBron James
Cause I got all the game, used to move Daddy the King
Gettin' dirty money with my lil'
[Hook]
Aiyo, where the fuck is that blunt at?
Where y'all niggas hoggin' the shit man?
Two pulls of that shit nigga start gettin' paranoid and shh
Get your fuckin', get your feet off my fuckin' table nigga!
Fuck you think you at home, with your cheap fur on?
Shit look like it 'bout to bite somethin' and shit nigga
Yo, yo, it was the night before he got popped
Big jars of haze, Cheech and Chong bong in the spot
Tropicana, strawberries, diced bananas
The long dookie fifth, next to the Town House crackers
Mad noise, 2008, a G a game
I'm ridin on ? in the love seat, sunk deep
Long nigga bustin' out they punk heat
I make a massacre, try to rob one of my donkeys
But I ain't wettin' that
I don't wanna send nobody back, violently, fakin' that
Promise you, got somethin' Lord that'll honor you
Blow your little head off while you're tyin' your shoe
But back in the kitchen, Pyrex's
Occupied by the twins, bank robbers with large records
Hard vest-es, '86 ga-ga John ?
Benatar rockin' some frames and fake guns when they rob Sha Born
'Til then they snatch you, axe you
Play the squid-ad, we gettin' at you
And we don't wanna rap to you, it's not kosher
It's not a code in la costa nostra to roast ya
I get a lil' closer
Rock you to sleep, like I got these lil' bitches, come over!
Hopin' you fall for the bait, thinkin' you safe
Have that ass sweatin' like T.D. Jakes
I want the ones nigga, you non-believers you can ask your Momma
Now that's drama
Uh, dollar icey from, papi with the scraper, glock with the laser
Tryin' my best not to pop yet but the drop is major
Shot my lil' cous', I do my art to favor, watch this
I never been this itchy, hope these cops just
Get a donut urge and just splurge, you got the nerve to play third?
In a softball tournament round my waist, yeah that's ya word
You bird, I'll put your beak on the curb but anyway
Looks like a good game, the pigs ain't leavin' so I'mma lay
Nice play, just too bad it's your last
Couple bundles of D, and 200 cash that sat you in the grass
I watch the teams line up, shake hands, guess the game's over
Faggot nigga hopped in the Liberty, fake Range Rover
I'm on his (Tail) like, Sonic lil' shorty
Palmin' on a 40, broad day I'm tryin' to dodge a cover story
Look like he stoppin for gas, I'mma pluck 'em, yay
This had to be his most, unlucky lucky day
Two brothers come out 7/11 in Army wear and stand there
I'm actin' like my tires need air
He close the gas cap, too many things goin' his way
So I just cash that, y'all probably think I'm buggin' but hey
I know them games in Lindsay Park is every Sunday, he ain't goin' nowhere
I went home, switch gear, went out and grabbed me a beer
Ten drinks later I'm at Burger King window for a Whopper
Look left and see partner, I hit the stash Blaka!
Now that's drama
Who the fuck you think you is, Ron O'Neal?
Tat-tat, what the fuck when that 9-milli peel
(Is it real?) Realer than Pittsburg (Steel)
Yo Ghost pass the toast, these niggas is daffodils
Got butt-naked bitches countin' half a mil', gloves on
Fully dressed bitches watchin' them, with they snubs on
While I'm in the kitchen pretendin' to be Raekwon
Watchin' Rachael Ray all day, I get my cake on
Fiends love me like a Drake song
Rep that Lou' Vuitton Bottom in my back pocket all day long
Black Wall Mafia, Wu-Tang Sopranos
Niggas say they pushin' keys but we don't see pianos
Niggas say they pushin' Phantoms, we don't see the opera
Niggas steady rockin' dreads, you ain't even rasta
Take your New Era off, and reveal
The faggot nigga you are or your cap gettin' peeled
Then we out to Brazil, I know niggas in Negril
that'll chop your fuckin' head off, and throw it on the grill
Take the gold out your mouth and throw it in they grill
Send a finger to your moms and let her know that it's real
Nigga we in the field like Chris Johnson
It's 2010, how the fuck we get six Thompsons?
Top 10, how the fuck you gon' forget Compton?
Every rapper on your list'll get they shit stomped in
I started Su-Wu, I'm the reason for that 5 shit
Came in the game, on that fuckin' "Ready to Die" shit
Sold 9 mil', ended up on some fly shit
Naked pictures, R&B; bitches all in my Sidekick
How I be killin' the pussy, should be a hate crime
Got a Blackberry, was gettin' too much face time
Back to fuckin' project bitches, now I hate dimes
All they want is money my nigga, I can't waste mine
I son/sun niggas like it's daytime
Gray cotton Louie sweatsuit, with the Ralph Lauren waistline
Smooth as a baby's ass, and I got that Baby cash
Catch me in the hood, same deals Old Navy had
Motherfuckers
Ace of Spades
If you like to gamble I tell you I'm your man
You win some loose some it's all the same to me
The pleasure is to play makes no difference what you say
I don't see the green the only color for me is the ace of spades the ace of spades
Going for the high one dancing with the devil
Going with the flow it's all a game to me
Seven come eleven snake's eye is watching you
Double up or quit the devil takes a split the ace of spades the ace of spades
You know I'm born to loose and gambling is for fools
But that's the way I like it baby I don't wanna live forever
Don't forget the joker
Pushing up the anty I know you've gotta see me
Read them and weep the dead man's hand again
I see it in your eyes take one look and die
The only thing you'll see you know it's gonna be the ace of spades the ace of spades
[Game - Verse 1]
I'm sitting here watching my daughter being born
Feel like I should thank God that nothing went wrong
Back in my days I was headed straight for the graveyard
Running from school cause enemies never stay far
Wear my colors watching colors chasing after my older brothers
Cause they was always into shit, good thing we had different mothers
Playing football in the streets with the homies
And local drug dealers kicking back making money cause the crack fiend
Was always there so I start selling that cane cause nobody never cared
Mama at the post office working that late night shift
Taking care of my sisters cause my daddy wasn't shit
Sweating over the stove and on a school clothes
Open the refrigerator like where did the food go?
Trying to do whatever I can to be a man, hope you understand
Even when shit goes wrong it's part of God's plan, Amen
[Chorus]
Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray to Lord my soul to keep
Wake me up before I'm dead
Don't bury me with monsters in my head, yeah
Monsters in my head, with monsters in my head
Underneath the bed, underneath the bed
[Game - Verse 2]
Laying here staring at this Doggystyle poster on my wall
Banging Snoop Dogg spinning this basketball, what the f-ck is going on?
In a n-gga head, all of my homies gone to jail, or they end up dead
Got my first tattoo tear when I was 19, chasing a pipe dreams
Chrenshaw boulevard chilling, that was the night scene
And like the movies, n-ggas act a fool
When you pushing a beemer, who gives a f-ck about a School?
Mom's seta curfew, but I was breaking all the rules
Kicked a n-gga out the house so I started forming my crew
Getting a little bigger on my own, in the 12 grade crips scheming on me
Cause they know my trap self made, trying to get by or getting high
That's how I survived, be a leader not a follower, that's how them cowards die
Pay 'em no mind but keep my chrome to the end of time
Feeling like no n-gga can see me I think they're going blind
[Chorus]
Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray to Lord my soul to keep
Wake me up before I'm dead
Don't bury me with monsters in my head, yeah
Monsters in my head, with monsters in my head
Underneath the bed, underneath the bed
[Game - Verse 3]
Seemed like just yesterday a n-gga was only 21
Showing the little homies how to use a f-cking gun
Now look what I become, n-gga was on the run
from the coptom slums, they right, like father like son
but I'm missing them days when I couldn't roll up a blunt
Bust the windows out of cars just to only drive it once
Yeah them was the days but now a n-gga getting paid
Pouring down rose for my n-ggas in the grave
My n-gga Big Will and my homie P D
Feel like yesterday we was just running in the streets
And I swear to God funny how the time fly
And the only thing certain is that we all die
So let your soul fly
[Chorus]
Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray to Lord my soul to keep
Wake me up before I'm dead
Don't bury me with monsters in my head, yeah
Monsters in my head, with monsters in my head
Underneath the bed, underneath the bed
Since Big ain't here, I'm about to do it for T'yanna
And put roses on the grave of Kanye's mama
This for all the lost girls locked up in the pen
All the girls that hold it down, getting beat on by they man
Respect women, I don't care if they a 2 or a 10

Come talkin' that trash and we'll pull your car
I'm in the 6-4, 5th bitch strapped, no roof, roof
The Snowman pimp, bitch shoes on the coupe
Stepped in 100 deep, deep, blew a few bucks
G'd up a pair of black strings in the chucks
My wrist so rocky and my neck so bright
My stones change colors like a disco light
Whole team strapped up, let a nigga trip
Desert Eagle in the club, better, nigga flip
From the south to the west, I stay in a vest
Fully loaded, Smif N Wess to protect my nest
Let you trip, disrespect, you get checked
More direct, you end up with a hole in your neck
I must confess there's got to be somethin in the water
Cause every year I age, I gets harder and harder
Got a team of cutthroats, niggaz with hood hoes
Tryin' to cope slum dough, whenever the guns blow
Yeah, being a gangsta is so neat, yeah
Gangsta beat 4 tha street

This just the beginning so don't fuck with us, yeah
Being a gangsta is so neat, yeah

[Verse 1 - Busta Rhymes]
All I know is how to smash on everybody record and do what I do
And make somebody have to go and get a hearse
Yo, Game I don't really give a fuck if it's your record
And you my brother my nigga look I got to rhyme fresh
See the way I coming, how I do the game, church
Ask somebody, you got to know you need to get a nurse
Let me bang them with another killer, then we put a couple bottles on the chiller
Kill them with another verse
Everybody see the way I be going and going
How I do it
Niggas the only way we know it, but then again, yes we do
We knowing how I be banging
And every sheet that I get
All the heat I be packing
And I show it off
With all this money you know where I'm heading
And I'm going to get the Jordans the patent 11 leathers
They really banging all the way down to the feathers
And I get a couple pair with all this money I be getting
And I kill them with the bounce, you see the way a nigga stepping
And we pop bottles and we rock J's, see me repping
Let me show you way I do it before I hit you with the weapon
Don't be spilling liquor all over my shit, give me a second
Shit, anyway, see we got to get it up
Probably feeling models up
Let me wrap a bottle up
Let me see everybody put your liquors bottle up
[Verse 2 - Rick Ross]
Bitches, I'm getting money, bottles and rocking chains
Money like I'm LeBron, my whip collection insane
Suicidal thoughts, highway to heaven riding like a boss
Condominium in the clouds, sixty G's a month
Fifty floors, marble walls, pictures of Boston Georgia
Bitches snorting blow, fucking fast, and cooking dope
Sanctify, Bally shoes, Audemars, Franck Muller, that Chopard
My new bitches must menage, I'm a G
[Chorus]
[Verse 3 - Game]
Bottles and rocking J's
Smoking and sipping Spades
Pistol tucked in my Louis
Heat it up like I'm Wade
Nigga don't do LeBrons, Kobe up on the weekends
Jordans Monday through Friday, especially when I'm freaking
Them cool greys, that's Monday
Them Space Jams, that's Tuesday
Them Spike Lee's, on Wednesday
23 in my Benz, aye
You know I love them sixes, especially on my bitches
13s and them spandex on Thursday, it's your birthday
And Friday I ain't lying, King of Diamonds, I'm in heaven
Red bone, pussy popping on my black and red 11's
Patent leather when I step in
You know what I'm repping
It's S-double-O, W-Double-O
Black number 4s I aint get it from the store, Bus know
That all I know is
[Chorus]
[Verse 4 - Fabolous]
I put footprints in them couches
I put so much in my two step
Put on for my city, I ain't got no choice but to rep
I put straight shots in they hair
Make pretty girls, do the ugly face
And they just my song on
Move back I need dougie space like aye, aye
Then its right back to my mugging face
Niggas saying put the weed out
BBM, you bugging face
We walked in, want something, bottles pop like we won something
Raise a glass for everybody that's done something from nothing
No grind, no shine, dress code, we pay no mind
Cargos and J's on, they let sun in, no blinds
All I drink is my shit
Stop playing, YouTube
But tonight we on that red berry and cranberry, SooWoo
[Verse 5 - Lil Wayne]
And I'm smoking on that purp
Sipping on that purp
I came in this bitch with some niggas that will murk
And we ain't about all that talking, you a dead man walking
Stomp a nigga ass out, in these number 4 Jordans
Got a scope on the barrel, that's a hammer with a camera
Hollow tips nigga, tip a nigga like a dancer
I don't know nothing but bitches and getting money
Blood gang, kill a nigga in public
Young Tunechi
Shoot a nigga ass up then it's deuces
Head shots, that fucking vest is so useless
Yeah, yo Chuck, fuck these niggas
You know who P-I-ru?
Killer B's nigga
[Chorus]
Yeah, East Side, said we ridin' at East Side
Say, please roll up while we [Incomprehensible]
Say, please roll up that we [Incomprehensible]
You know I keep my eyes wide
East Side high risers, West Side lowriders
Vest with the four fire, yes, I fo' sho' fire
D I P lowrider, see police, slow the ride
See scwalay, nigga
'Cause they be thinkin' that the ride stolen
Keep your head up an' your eyes open
Load the lead up while the ride rollin'
Creep up on a motha like, "What you say, fucka ?"
Well fuck him an' if he live smoke him
We don't appeal to the law
You know we ride this motherfucker till 'em wheels fall off
An' the first bastard get fly
You know blad blad blad, was my reply
89 Wolf Pack an' we wylin'
P 89 pull gats 'cause we violent, shit
Yeah, we put coke on the strip
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't said shit
Since I made a gang of bucks, nah, I ain't been hangin' much
Still slide through fly coupes an' the chains is plush
Keep the banger tucked 'case I had to bang a fuck
'Cause we Certified Gangstaz
All day we hangin' smut dog, wit a gang of ducks
Hundred grand on the hand, Game got the range of trucks
Kill wit the deal, still got cane to cut
'Cause we Certified Gangstaz
We still in ages of glocks, razors or octs
'Cause I lay in the drop, pump the base on the pocket
Move the H on our block, in front of H an' are block
See the face on our watch, put your face on our cock
I keep the looga hug, show you how to use the snub
Whoop te woo, fuck around, be you I plug
I don't do the drugs, baby, I move the drugs
Right on the computer, love, it sound like computer love
Duck the cop cappers an' the top hatters
Fock flavors, Harlem world, we got gators
Not dead, I said they alive
Lions, tigers, bears, oh, my
It's a straight zoo, A to Z, May to April
Bring the apes through, fuck around, you be ape food
Baked food, 9 bitches 8 dudes
Diamond visions, great cubes, get it straight, fool
Since I made a gang of bucks, nah, I ain't been hangin' much
Still slide through fly coupes an' the chains is plush
Keep the banger tucked 'case I had to bang a fuck
'Cause we Certified Gangstaz
All day we hangin' smut dog, wit a gang of ducks
Hundred grand on the hand, Game got the range of trucks
Kill wit the deal, still got cane to cut
'Cause we Certified Gangstaz
You know I ride through Lennox, all eyes on my pendant
But I'm movin' like, oh, Dog was riddin' a menace
Wit that automatic weapon, blowin' live through my tenant
While I'm breezin' through the jects, blowin' live on the tenants
I'm pourin' liquor for the dead an' gone
An' we retaly same night, load the blinkers wit the letters on
We come to get you till the dead an' morn
Knock, knock, wake up, mothafucker, you know who it is
Killa an' Jones coppin' one dawn
Big birds, the rocks an' our charms
He got the bird, the glocks in my palm
I got the word from King Joffrey, the bomb
My nigga Zeekey surely a hard rock
How he survived them 40 sum odd shots
As we ride, he screamed out, "East Side"
All the time as I reply
Since I made a gang of bucks, nah, I ain't been hangin' much
Still slide through fly coupes an' the chains is plush
Keep the banger tucked 'case I had to bang a fuck
'Cause we Certified Gangstaz
All day we hangin' smut dog, wit a gang of ducks
Hundred grand on the hand, Game got the range of trucks
Kill wit the deal, still got cane to cut
'Cause we Certified Gangstaz
Yeah, yeah, what you seen here
Is Certified Gangstaz on this shit
Jim Jones, [Incomprehensible] status
Dipset, New York's robbin' man
Killa the dawn a.k.a King Joffrey Jo
You know how we ride out
Shout to my G's, "Keep your head up an' eyes open"
Dipset
Just me and you girl
Mars
Baby you're the one
Oh
Let it rock, yeah yeah
She leave her hair in the sink
She leave her hair on the floor
Her hair all over the bed, that make me love her more
She wear a scarf, Louis V to be exact
It's a wrap, messing up her wrap, blowing out her back
Never let another rap nigga hit it from the back or the front
On my mama nigga, I be gone for months, come back
And it's still tight, I like when it's real tight
I'mma lick in circles now
Tell me what that feel like
Feels like when you try them red bottoms on
It feels like the song 'cause we all the way gone
Between me and you, do anything for old girl
Like hit it in the morning, yeah, cold world
[Chorus]
Baby you're the one
You ain't gotta hit the club no more
'Cause we done did that
Tryin' to find the one
But you been looking for love in all the wrong places
Every day's a movie, girl, you make the scene
They gon' keep on watching, give 'em something to see
We gonna be all the way gone
We gonna be all the way gone
She call me all the time, I ain't no regular Joe
I be staying at the Roosevelt more than Marilyn goes
I'm messing bitches with Chuck, but I was wearing some foams
Shorty been fly forever, these bitch's parachutes broke
TC's is on her person I'm aware that you know
And you know the flow, they jack it, I'm apparently cold, you know
Life's lemons is bitter, I need another fruit
She know we can't elope, look at what honey do
Straight G thing, double M G thing
Weed they can't fuck with, I'm puffin A.C. Green
When I peep in the public, bet I'm leaving with something
And I'm so fly I make some homebodies leave the luggage
Shout out Donny Sublime
Shout out Bobby on Hundreds
Not too many is touching, double M G this summer
The Red album, lil' red shorty, you can't touch her
I know Mario's on the hook, but I was playing Duck Hunt
[Chorus]
Yeah, he blowing up your cell phone
Send him the voice mail cause we all the way gone
And you ain't doing nothing wrong
But killing the competition in that Cosabella thong
Turn to the side, let me see them thighs
Profile, damn I'm digging your style, we can start slow now
Then speed it up, this playing in the background
While I beat it up, I beat it up
Baby soon as we get home, it won't take us too long
We gon' make it to the bedroom, I like the guest room
You can pick the next room
Put the camera on the tripod, got me playing on your iPod
I know you feeling me on my job, director
Cut
[Verse 1]
Today Jimmy Hendrix is motivation
I guess it's time for me to put them 808s in
Middle finger to them faggot niggas hating
And Sak Pase to all my f-cking Haitians
Give me a pimp cup to pour my Rose in
I'm in the same car that Ricky Rozay in
Tell Satan that it's a celebration
So get your hands up, nigga get your hands up
Now, which one of us is really Mr. West?
Probably the one of us that really needs to wear his vest
And I'm just shooting my niggas some subliminals
'Cuz he got all the bitches and I be with the criminals
Beat sound like some crazy shit that Tim would do
Now when you see me, I'm the brown Eminem to you
Show you what I'm finna do, but you don't know it's me though
Magic when I shoot, get to boxing like Hedo
Turkoglu, niggas, get to murking you niggas
Hit your block in the Caprice and just circle you niggas
Know what I mean? Think you pheens how I'm serving you niggas
Know what I mean? Think I'm beans how I'm serving you niggas
And it ain't rice and beans when I'm serving you niggas
Punk you in front of your crew, Steve Urkel you niggas
Putting bull shit out, I hope it works for you niggas
And when it don't, come and see me, I got that work for you niggas
[Hook X2]
Like uh (Mr. West, Mr. West!)
Uh (Mr. West, Mr. West!)
Uh (Mr. West, Mr. West!)
Now, which one of us is really Mr. West?
[Verse 2]
He had a Rolls, I had a Rolls too
Eat your money up, you know how them hoes do
Burn rubber, swear to God they gon' love ya
Like rookie cops, can't wait to be undercovers
I'm 6'5, nigga basketball size
You act like I can't f-ck one of them basketball wives
I be a basketball Game, with my basketball dame
Feeling like, Hov, call back, I'm watching basketball dang
Damn, but I ain't talking 'bout dames
I ain't talking bout Hov, I'm just talking bout Game
Ask Ray Allen, they boy got game
Jesus Shuttlesworth, yeah the boy got range-s
In the parking lot, niggas talk a lot
They way they gossiping hip-hop should be a barber shop
Getting cash money baby, why you tryna baller block?
Mad chick, her's, man somebody gotta call the shots
[Hook]
[Bridge]
I guess it's me y'all, the highest on the see saw
Get so much money, why the f-ck would I wann be y'all?
Shit, I be everywhere, but I don't ever see y'all
So for the next 12 songs, I'mma fucking R.I.P. y'all
[Verse 3]
Sometimes I hear anger talking, asking how I'm feeling
I'm just happy to be alive, Lord willing
Four albums later, two more children
Feeling like 'Ye, "Mr. West is in the building"
What happened to the competition? Nigga I killed 'em
Can't drink Crystal, the nigga Hov chilled 'em
I'm on this patent rhyme like I know them niggas
Them haters say I fell off? I'm 'bout to show them niggas
Drake and J. Cole them niggas
I sold nine mill, made nine mill, and kept it hood nigga
Just like Drake told a nigga
I made it rain in hundreds like I was Big Meech
I made it rain in hundreds when I was with Meech
Went from a Cutlass with the old front end
To a, um, Benz, stop light jumping
Now I'mma take you back to where I got jumped in
West side Compton, just east of the one ten
[Hook Number 2]
I just roll weed on your last album
And after that I'm 'bout to f-ck your girl for 'bout an hour
Look around the club, uh, all I see is cowards
Mad 'cuz I got respect, the money, and the power
I just roll weed on your last album
And after that I'm 'bout to f-ck your girl for 'bout an hour
Look around the club and all I see is cowards
Mad 'cuz I got respect, the money, and all the power
[Verse 4]
"No one man should have.." 'Ye said that
"Can't knock the" Naw, Jay said that
"You can thank me" Naw, Drake said that
"Mind playing tricks on me" Scarface said that
But I'm about to roll this paper plane
Hit the barber shop, get cut before this Laker game
Niggas hate The Game, sometimes I hate the fame
They hate my bitch, they hate my chain
I'm so hood, I might fly to New York and just take the train
On some John Travolta shit, just take the train
So if you in New York at two o'clock, don't take the train
I make niggas dissapear, no David Blaine
I split your whole team up, no Jay and Dame
Fresher than Will Smith was before Jada came
Four albums, twelve cars, but the flow stay the same
Every nigga I dap turn blood, it's like I'm made of flames
Dipping this red flag, like the one I gave to Wayne
[Hook Number 2]
[Verse 5]
Go Dwight Howard, now watch them hoes run
Soon as the Game over, they back stripping for ones
Had your bitch all in my crib, stripping for fun
Getting head, thinking 'bout cars when I strip 'em for fun
Walk in my closet, throw on my J's, pick up my gun
Spin the block with some some shit that spit quicker than Pun
I respect two East Coast niggas, Biggie was one
If he was living, he'd say that no one is sicker then son, uh
Young gun, bar none, the tightest where I'm from
Roll some much kush, got the leaves sticking to my thumb
As I break it down , bring that six tray around
Banging Nas album, yeah, you can hate me now
Treat beef like haircuts, gotta fade it down
Ran out bars, guess I name-drop Slim and Baby
How can niggas hate on me? 'cuz I get Cash Money
Six bricks in the Aston Martin, that's fast money
[Hook Number 2]
Graveyards in my pocket.
Tombstones in my wallet.
If you talkin' 'bout my profit,
All I see is dead people.
All I see is dead people.
You starve so when my momma tryna make a couple dollars,
Any nigga with a problem, they be dyin' over dead people.
Muthafuckin' dead people.
This shit gets deep.
Don't fuck with me.
You end up six feet deep.
Listen to how I did it.
I crept up slow on Willow.
Thinkin' 'bout climbin' through the fuckin' window.
In the backseat, potato burners.
Ski mask, body bag, duct tape, and a pillow.
In the front solo.
Sittin' low with the lights out.
Feelin' like Manson on some Sonny Sam shit.
With a murder on my mind that my mind on the homicide,
And my watch said they outta time.
Somebody gotta die, bottom line.
Front page, column nine.
Headline: Another Columbine.
I plan and plot and strategized, and thought about it.
Loaded up everything in the closet.
My objective is to get bloody.
They can beg and plead, yell and scream.
Try to leave, get in cheese, pray to God on they knees, but I'm still gettin' fucking ugly.
I fuckin' love it.
Took this nigga by his throat and fuckin' cut it and thought nothin' of it.
It's simple insanity.
Just a murderous fantasy.
It's simple insanity.
Just a murderous fantasy of mine.
(Man, I feel like killin me a mother fucka.)
Last night, I must've had a blast choppin up bodies.
Woke up bloody as fuck in the hospital lobby.
Body filled with adrenaline.
Not rememberin what I did to get all this blood on my fuckin' Timberlands.
Cop's sayin I did what to him?
Showin me pictures of cut-up bitches, disfigured members with body parts missin.
Listen, I ain't do shit, I don't know shit.
Man, I don't give a fuck about that bitch.
Fuck whatever she said, fuck whatever she saw, it wasn't me.
Oh no no, not me.
Listen to the alibi.
I was at the movies, that Avatar shit,
With them 3-D glasses on,
And that shit longer than mother fucka.
Look at my pocket, get the tickets though.
That's my alibi, bitch.
Now what up?
Fresh out the cuffs, now I'm back on the outside,
And headed west where Homicide reside.
That's my nigga.
He live on 1st and 48th right next to the white chalk in between the yellow tape,
Behind the black gate.
Rottwielers and pitbulls, surrounded by snakes, AK's and AR's.
Some niggas hard to play, some niggas play hard
But that house right there, don't go in they yard
It's simple insanity.
Just a murderous fantasy.
It's simple insanity.
Just a murderous fantasy of mine.
(Man, I feel like killin me a mother fucka.)
Beware of dark shit, shot 'em through the fence
Tough offensive line men couldn't stop the blitz.
Them niggas inside, a couple kittens
And this right here, good riddance.
Nigga fuck around, it's suicide for instance
Picture the mind of a bullet
Here I come I can smell the flesh aimin' for your head or neck.
Nigga, pray to God I won't hit your chest.
Now here I come straight outta drum, headed for your lungs.
You in my sight.
The last one didn't do it right,
And I'm waitin.
Just lookin at you.
Thinkin about it and gettin tired of lookin at you.
Hi, daddy, remember me?
Goodbye, daddy, this is what it gotta be.
You brought me in this world, now I'm takin you out.
Now you open up your muthafuckin mouth.
Simple insanity.
Just a murderous fantasy.
Simple insanity.
Just a murderous fantasy of mine.
(Now I feel like killin me a mother fucka.)

This is not livin'
Livin' is when you working a 9-5
Liftin' heavy ass boxes just to stay a-f-cking-live
N-gga aint got a car but he got drive
So he appreciate the rims sittin on his ride
The world going crazy, n-ggas going crazy
They say the Illuminati affiliated Jay-Z
I'm in this Mercedes seeing how L.A be
My life should be a movie shot by Martin Scorsese
Gun's off safety n-ggas is Polamalu
The cops killed BIG and drove off in the Impala
And Pac did biz? just to get a couple dollars
F-ck rap, I shoulda took my black ass to college
[Hook]
I'm just tryna be real
I'm just keepin' it real
I'm just tryna be real
I'm just keepin' it real
I'm just keepin' it real
I'm tryna see my kids through college before I gotta die
Still sayin' R.I.P Aaliyah 'fore I gotta fly
N-ggas running out of time
So they doing homocide
Gotta take the stand tell the judge and jury their alibi
And they all racist so they giving boys 25
Stand up be a man, and stare straight into his momma eyes
And she still traumatised, her baby boy shot up
Kissed him on the forehead right before he got up
You shot him in the forehead twice before he got up
All over a bitch, n-gga the devil wears Prada
Amber Rose wears nada
And thats how she should keep it
'cause you can go Tyra from wearing Victoria's Secrets
They say there's a secret society
To get notoriety from selling your soul to 'em
N-gga you aint buying me
Only thing for sale is this Phantom
It's Aftermath, thats why I rep the A like Atlanta
[Hook]
They say I look like Kanye or Wale in this Louie napsack
Rather be them than them dumb n-ggas f-cking with Kat Stacks
I smoke kush to get my mind right
I used to listen to Nas to get my rhymes tight
I used to sell them dimes and keep my 9 tight
But now I'm f-cking them dimes, but in hindsight
Almost turned on my family for the limelight
And I'mma go see God when the times right
They say the purly gates white but my President black
My money green, the sky blue and thats where heaven is at
I don't carry a gat, but my n-ggas do
It's like my jumper is off, I let my n-ggas shoot
and don't none of my n-ggas do
Take the time to listen
I'll tell you what my n-ggas do
Scream Suwoo while they dumping out of billy coupes?
But i'm just tryna be a good n-gga, master
and take this rap money and give this shit to the Pastor
[Hook]
[Game 1st verse]
This for my nigga C-Murder, locked away
This for the nigga conscious that took Pac away
This For The Niggas screaming On Me But Not Today
This for the niggas thinking' I was all Dr. Dre
This For The Magasin Writers words with a Lot Say
Come To My Hood It enough Good We Cocking Spray
Keep It Gully Like we are For Rock AWAY
Trick Gangsta Rap Like A hood
Come through the hood with a model chick that I got from 'Ye
And Rose Phantom Limitage Just a Block A wAY
So Let the Beat Not While you bob your head,
I switch cars Jump in the C.L., Smoother than Pete Rock
air Max 95, flow classic like reboc
Members O1 try Lay Me Down like Shirak
R.i.P To All Them Niggas And All My Niggas
[chorus x2]
Don't Don't End Up dead
Nigga Don't Don't up Dead
[Game 2nd Verse ]
One thing about me,
always keep it real with myself
Like Nas, I'm Ill Will with myself
And I can feel the pain of Ms. Wallace
I wish Chris was here, so he could see C.J. blow
Like the paint on this Impala
Tell Afeni to holla if she need another son that rap
Pac's revengeAnd I got a gun that clap like Dr. Dre snares
Blow chronic like Dr. Dre cares
I been there, done that Dr. Dre shares all his bitches and his liquor
He ain't call me for Detox, but that's my nigga
Remember Who Brought Em Back To Compton
nd 23 year Old Me was a fuckin Monsters
Still Niggas Say i Aint Hood what Fuck They Taking Bout
Like I want Kiss My Son on the Head nd Chuck em out
What up 50? Let's talk it out/But until we talk it out
[chorus x2]
Don't Don't End Up dead
Nigga Don't Don't up Dead
[Game 3rd Verse]
I remember when my older brother wanted to be Rakim
Now I'm livin' his dream, cause somebody shot him
And left me like Eric B. without Rakim
Still payed them for like B.B.S stock Rims
Now I Got California locked In
Dip in this Beamer,Same model, different year they shot Pac in
So whats The Top 10 If You Dead
Who Drop This Lamborghini If Im In the feds
To Times Feeling spelling my Nights Up In The Bed
But I'm From Compton so When Im Out Its Infrared
Get My Son ready For School nd I kiss His Heads
So When You See My Face In The Mirror
If i End Up Dead Bed
Never War Bullet Proof Vest and No Got Bullet Proof Car
You Know Me Westside Triple O.G
And I'ma tell you like the homie Snoop Dogg told me
[chorus x2]
Don't Don't End Up dead
Nigga Don't Don't up Dead
Doug E Fresh: (talking)
Someone say
who that cat
runnin' through that
ask how he do that
easy.
(beat boxing)
who that cat
runnin' throught that
ask how he do that easy.
(beat boxing)
Yo whats up yall' this is Doug E. Fresh, and I got my boy Big Daddy Kane, and KRS-One is in here
and Game [Game: yeah], matter fact Game you know what [Game: yeah]
Game:
Razor sharp
my flow is like a crip and blood fightin' in the park, come to Compton swim with the sharks.
I know the real kings of New York,
that make me five borough
thorough pass me the torch.
A young Kane
I'm insane my membrane has the capacity to jack rappers and take chains,
a lot of fake KRS' a lot of fake Game's,
I'ma cash in on you n****s and make change.
Little ass dogs I'm a Great Dane
product of hip hop like spray paint on a freight train
and while you n****s tried to make Kane,
I made Kane
while Kane playin' on that little tape thang,
I got my first boom box in 85'
carrying that heavy mothe f****r I was maybe 5,
or maybe 6,
so what I'm tryin' to tell you
is I've been fucking with hip-hop since the 80's bitch.
Chorus:
KRS-One spits like...
Doug Fresh beat box like rhaaa
and you know that kane spit like...
and that's the reason game spit like...
KRS-One spits like...
Doug Fresh beat box like rhaaa
and you know that kane spit like...
and that's the reason game spit like...
KRS-One:
Rappers don't like when KRS on tour
cause when I rhyme they wrist don't glist no more
all you see is that dark ___?
and these rappers promoting all this rape and war
I'm ignorant when I'm on tour
they say I'm down to irk? cause I put rappers brains on the floor
you heard that song chicken noodle soup
thats what you head gon' look like in the back of your coupe
like some one threw up in your rear view
after you battle KRS-One no ones ever gonna wanna hear you
notice the style of music you loose it
I'll scald your face like them cats in Houston
you know it's funny how you love to talk
but still stuck in the hood I rose above New York
I be in the Bronx eating pounds of kush?
your like a fag in front of the pussy beating around the bush.
Chorus
Big Daddy Kane:
Hey yo
You ain't got no other choice but to like it or love it
when you see me with the game it's nothing like Michael Douglass
the black costa knowsta?
He who got the mosta
the toxic flows and yall' lames is not supposed ta
I spit it clearly
my styles the shitterary?
when I write about cats it's called obituaries
I never fuck with lame so don't bring that n***a near me
I'm universal
your deafest jam is a subsidiary
One question playa who want see
there really somethin' real spit it two blunt leaf
I locked down the East and opened new country
and ran through the West when it was mostly 2-1-3 (chhhhh)
look om? I took one to Brook non?
I look calm but I gotta enough hoods to start a crook farm?
the guard? is in the buildin and yes problems
when yall find chicks all I do is test drive em'
Chorus:
Doug E. Fresh: (talking)
Uh, now let em tell yall' something
see this whole thing came together in a special way, ya know what I mean
A very very special way
You just got the legends man, together
and you just created...a whole nother' level
because on the real...game straight up talk...from an MC perspective B
You are definitely...official, a legend and respected because you come from the heart
and that's what a real MC do
no matter what
and this was all just one night in the studio man jus hanging out
that's what we did
thats what happened
and you know
(beat boxing)
this is real man
(beat boxing)
this is all day
(beat boxing)
this is hip hop
(beat boxing)
til the very last drop uh
and let me tell ya' the last thing, imma' tell ya'
it's about original creation, from the heart
see an MC

ever
tryin' to be somebody else
just do you thing
and it will always work out
(beat boxing)
do that easy
(beat boxing)
all right game that's it man
Can I trust you gonna ride for me like I ride for you?
Future Hendrix
Money we burn it on bitches like candles
Can I trust you gonna ride for me like I ride for you?
I speak your name and it's royalty
You see the stress and my loyalty
You gotta be there for me through the casualties
You see my trials and my tribulations
You can tell them demons tryna capture me
Only thing that ever mattered to me was my niggas
I know these niggas gonna ride, yeah, squeeze triggers
You gotta put in some time for this
Almost lost my mind for this
Fuck all that crying lil bitch
Niggas round my way, they dying for this
Fuck all these bitches, I'm yours
Only thing that ever mattered to me was my niggas
Fuck all these bitches, I'm yours
You already know me, know how I get down
Know I'm with the shit when I pull up
Any nigga ever disrespected you from the beginning
I put the chrome to his neck like a pull up
You know a nigga bang Cedar block
You was bool with it, wasn't you?
Talkin' 'bout when a nigga gonna leave the block alone
But you never say this shit when I'm fucking you
We was the Huxtables, everything was perfect
Everything was working
We had some beautiful kids together
Had a nigga feeling like everything was worth it
Closet full of Birkins
How you make a nigga spend a million dollars on purses?
Then have an attitude
Like you in the studio helping a nigga write verses
Had a nigga focused on the future, now a nigga feeling like Future
We both dealing with a new nigga 'round our kids
And we ain't kill 'em yet, nigga, I salute you
And I still bang like I used to, red Impala, gold things like I used to
Pick up my kids, they don't see none of that
But when I'm back in the hood I'm yelling soo woo!
And it was all good just a week ago
Shit, we was Nicki and Meek a week ago
Gave you everything, the watch, the house, the cards
Tatted your passport, and now you wanna see me low
Wanna take my pussy, give it to the next nigga free
One thing about the next nigga
He just the next nigga, he can never be me
I'm coming to get my kids and they momma like
Fuck all these bitches, I'm yours
Only thing that ever mattered to me was my niggas
Fuck all these bitches, I'm yours
Compton ain't the same
Where all these bitch niggas come from?
Can't even take a fade or ride through the hood
Without niggas hands out like they want some
But where you at when I need you?
See most of these niggas see through
You throw up a P, I throw up a P too
You pulling out heat, I draw the heat too
Compton made me like this, nigga
Fuck all these bitches, get money and die
Hundred niggas in my section, hundred Rollies in the sky
There's a hundred little niggas that will bang on a nigga
Put the flame on a nigga, take chains from a nigga
That will go BG, Turk and Wayne on a nigga
When the club get cloudy let it rain on a nigga
We are with the shit, let us redefine lit
That's in the club smoking on extendos, extendo with the clip
Standing on the couch like wah
Backwood hanging out my mouth like wah
Who the fuck want a problem?
Once you're shot, leave a nigga dead on an island
Creep out the back door with my side bitch, aye
Fuck all these bitches, I'm yours
Only thing that ever mattered to me was my niggas
Fuck all these bitches, I'm yours
Oooh-oooh-oooh
Fuck these other bitches I just
Oooh-oooh-oooh
Fuck with them when issues begin
Oooh-oooh-oooh
I be with my niggas, when I'm
Oooh-oooh-oooh
Say I'm with my niggas, I just
Oooh-oooh-oooh
Don't you know there's no better time than when I'm with you?
But I can't control these temptations when a nigga not with you
You wanna be done with me, but your heart won't let it
Standing at the front door but you just can't exit
You wanna be with me
You wanna be with me, with me, with me, with me
Me, me, me, me
You wanna be with me, with me, with me, with me
Me, me, me, me
(Fuck all these bitches, I'm yours
Only thing that ever mattered to me was my niggas
Can a drummer get some

Can a, can a drummer get

Can, can a drummer get
(Can a drummer get some)
Boom, guess who stepped in the room
Dressed in black diamonds like a f-cking monsoon
Back from the dead but they never found my killer
So I jumped up out this grave like Michael Jackson in thriller
Iller than most emcee's cause I be killin' 'em
Most emcee's turn into ghost emcee's
Yeah, give a drummer some
If 32 seville when that all black Hummer run
Face off, Nicholas Cage with a gauge
I'm famous for killin' rappers, my style, grenade
Cook shit like Rae, the chef Raekwon
The beats are filet mignon without the A1.
Who walk like a pitbull, You' who bitch please
I ate your favourite rapper's heart out with a 16
Didn't hit the switch on something with fiends
Make money with Ruff Ryders, homie, thats Swizz Cheese!
Can a drummer get some

Can a drummer get some

Can a, can a drummer get

Bang, guess who checked in the game
Smoke in the air like LeBron James
Running this shit like he Ron Dayne
Pull out my dick and just pee on flames
She on Wayne, but she ain't what I be on
I'm Leon, I pee on you pee-on's for eon's
I'm in my prime like Deion
I'mma shine like neon
I'm a Lion like Leon
But I'm 'bout to go off, cause that is all I know of
I don't have to show y'all, I'd rather show off
Yeah, Travis on the Drums
Travis on the beat
Wayne got the smoke and Game got the heat
Weezy F I'm an F'ing star
Haha, get it' I'm an FN star
Ha, and it's the Rock you bastards
If I'm the rockstar, will rock you bastards
Can a drummer get some

Can a drummer get some
Can a, can a drummer get
can a, can a drummer get
Can, can a drummer get
(Can a drummer get some)
Tupac and Juice riding ' on the loose
King James round my neck, haters wish it was a noose
Long Maybach and I wish it was a coupe
Kush out the jar, car smellin' like duke
Quarter milli on the seat, yeah I know I'm a goof
Designer underwear she knows I'm a goose
Got the wide body I'm a fat muthaf-cker
In Swahili I'm screaming 'stack muthaf-cker'
Ya homie won't stop until I decide to
Until then I'm making rollie's for the homies to ride to
Smokes on the folds, folks wanna know
Bitch I'mma boss, best foots on the blow
Keep the hat pulled over, Big P on the front
Travis on the drums, big weed on the blunt
Being Savage where I'm from, Girls manage from the jump
Don't trap me like a punk, Travis handing me the pumps, so'
Can a drummer get some
Can a drummer get some
Can a drummer get some
Can a drummer get some
Can a, can a drummer get

Can, can a drummer get
(Can a drummer get some)
I'm at the house bout to roll this kush up
I can get a call at any minute, so I'm just doing push-ups
Waiting on what seems to be forever
I burned a hole in my Polo sweater 'cause I was nervous
But hat's how crazy birth is, loading up this Beretta
'Cause this time I'm having a baby girl
So it's whatever, whenever whatever
You my willow and it's my will to make this last forever
First thing I'ma tell her, daddy's your umbrella
Give her the glass slipper Cali, you my Cinderella
Gotta be a dream, hold up, that's your middle name
Both your brothers big now, so baby you my little Game
Who gon' be the Godfather? Swizz? Lil Wayne?
Hey y'all smoke too much but got Cali tatted on his veins
And I just got a text from your mama
Saying the water burst, I guess it's time for my comma
You walk through the door, she on the ground crying
She don't wanna get up, you had a baby right here
I ain't cleaning that shit up
I finally got her out the house, now we on the elevator
She screaming, her left the car seat, but I'ma tell her later
Forget the car seat, man, I'm hella-faded
She like "I know you ain't high!"
Shit, "I'm celebrating"
Now we in the car, she won't put on her seat belt
Screaming at the top of her lungs,"God, I need help!"
Weaving through traffic, minutes between contractions
Close your eyes right now, and you can see it happening
Imagine she pulling on me "Stop I'm about to crash, shit!"
Butterflies in my stomach, heart beating fast as shit
Every time I have a kid, it's like the first time
Kids the best, but they be coming at the worst times
Now we here, Tiff get in the wheelchair
Them butterflies still here, am I happy? Hell yeah
I parked the car, now I'm running through the halls lost
Trying to figure out which one of these rooms is ours
Think, think damn one of the nurses stuck their head out
They gave her an epidural so I pulled the couch bed out
Took a nap, woke up, they almost got the head out
She grabbing on the rails, looking like she about to pass out
Told her to breathe, grab my phone and hit record
"Breathe, one, two, three, four, one more, two, three, four
"Push, c'mon T, push! God damn it, just push!"
Nurse Linda coaching her, Doctor Umbar pulling on shoulders
Giving me the notion to cut the umbilical cord
She out, eight pounds four ounces, Sam stop the beat
Hold up, I'm about to make an announcement,
"See, every time a child is born somebody leave the world
So I thank the woman who gave her life for my baby girl"
"Hey mars turn the beat down a little so I can share my experience"

These niggas got me, I think

[Verse 1: Game]
I be on the block with that chrome boy, Postin' up with my home boy
Leanin' on the 2 tone boy, What you want for them zones boy
10-5, 10-4, put it on the scale, add a little more
Take a shot of that 'tron boy, bag it up and then gone boy
They givin' (?) out, watch yourself on that phone boy
They gave me seven (?), mama singing that song boy
We gettin' money baby, we gettin' cash money
Stuntin' like im Birdman, sittin' on my cash
120 on the dash, 4 (?) on the wheeeeels
Paper stacking too long boy, blowing cheech and that chong boy
Better watch that tone boy, headshots to that dome boy
[Hook X 2]
[Verse 2 - Menace]
Think a nigga trip the way I walk around
Gotta keep that pistol on my hip to lay them haters down
Gotta keep them bitches on my dick then I bring (?) around
Paper stash gon' break em down, fuck 'em hard don't make a sound
I'm all about that trap boy, ride around with that pistol
Gotta keep the bitch in my lap boy, hater niggas, come get ya
Made my niggas (?), my niggas clean, we do it (?), try to intervene
Thats suicide fuckin' with my team, I'm blowing clouds and I'm 'bout the cream
Yeah, and I'm bout that shit, we full of chips, and I'm (?) hoes
Y'all full of shit, not suckin' the O's, I'm too legit and I'm tippin' 4's
Niggas really want it, bitches lookin' silly for it
Really kill the niggas for it, niggas lookin' real important
[Hook X 2]
[Verse 3 - Game]
Say boy, ever had a bitch all up in your crib
Stickin' that dick all up in the ribs
Then she tell fuck niggas where you live
And now they all up in your shit
Flippin' matresses over, turnin' couches sideways
They thinkin' crime pays
Got a choppa
For the niggas that don't understand how the fuck we ope-
-rate and anyway get back on top of my paper chase
Kush burnin', smell the dragon, 29's, been had 'em
Niggas take shots, then runnin' high
We'll find their ass, Bin Ladin
Me and Mike in the Benz wagon, better watch your block boy
Purple clouds of that Pepe Lepue, I'm gone of that Ciroc boy
Clipped up to that pop boy, holdin' on to that knot boy
Palms grippin' that Glock boy, we comin' back for them yachts boy
[Hook X 2]
[Chorus]
All I know is this pain in this life
And this struggle it chose me so
All I know is that I'm stuck on this road
Of success so I got to get mine
All I know is this pain in this life
And this struggle it chose me so
All I know, all I know
Red phantom, they say I look like Josh Smith from Atlanta
I do, ha-choo, excuse you, that nigga look like me
He from the G.A., and I'm M easy, that's Game
I don't do what you niggas do, that's lame
I Soo Woo with my crew from the from the Burque
I Soo Woo with my crew, from under Young Wayne
A walkin' motherfuckin' flame livin' up to my brothers name
Rockin' that red shit, wasn't fuckin' with them other gangs
Amongst other things, they wasn't fuckin' with me
Ain't your average motherfucker, I'm a motherfuckin' G
I got some shit on my chest that I want to get off
I got some shit for that vest that will knock that bullshit off
Money like Madoff, Kill 'em like Adolf, Roy Halladay
I'll let a fuckin' K off, and I don't take a fucking day off
[Chorus]
Cincinnati C hat, Boston B hat, ? them Philadelphia P hats
Believe that, bring it to the hood so you can see that
Dumb ass niggas like Game, where the keys at?
Automatic start, nigga where the trees at?
Red boned bitch like Alisha, where the keys at?
Freeze that, like a fucking picture
If you ain't a blood I ain't fucking with ya nah I'm just fucking with ya
Stay on my hood shit, hop in the bucket with ya
Throw the ski mÃ¡sks on and get to straight fucking with ya
Ain't that some shit, that bustards sick
You wanna know how I'm livin' nigga ask your bitch
Told you precisely how to ask and sit, and she a nasty bitch
I came in her mouth ask her lips, you know why?
'Cause I had to go past them lips, trick
You probably paid for that ass and tits for
[Chorus]
Fuck with the blood clot, smile for my mug shot
Can't go out like 'em but I love Big, I love Pac
Love Fab, love Kiss that's where the love stops
'Casue I sleep with the enemy and I hug blocks
Birthed me in the drug spot, nigga with a attitude
Searching me is fuck cops, nigga pay your gratitude
Before you say I'm acting Ruth
Understand I'm tryna feed my people
Hati just like Compton the way I'm packing food
But I will act a fool, put cheese on your head
Motherfucker I will Green Bay Packer you
Have a whole football team of niggas after you
Like the public turn, when will you fucking learn
Now take your ass back to school
Wait till three o'clock click clack at you
And fuck with your conscience like back packers do
And I ain't Talib, Black Though or Mos Def
But I've seen the most deaths and nigga I'm just telling you
[Repeat: x5]
All I know

Walk in the store nigga eyes so low looking asian
[Verse 1 - Game]
Welcome to the graveyard
Where everybody like to pray: Allahu Akbar
You scared to say "God?" They call me Game because I play hard
So get your helmets and your face guards
I spit holy water, lets have a Face Off: Nicholas Cage
They say the boy is off the chain like two Pits in a cage
Your girl say my flow the bomb like I swallow grenades
Respect the rules up in this shit so you gotta get paid
Or you gotta get spayed like Windex with them twin Techs
I'll Raid on top of insects. Niggas die fuckin they family
Oh, where I'm from they call that "incest"
Open the Bible, good book serves its purpose for shook crooks
Heavenly Father, I think we in Heaven, be a good look
Sing the hook:
[Hook]
In this heartless world that I live in
I have learned that I can't depend on love
It hasn't made me a Saint
So I'mma take it all with me to the graveyard
[Verse 2 - Game]
The cemetery ain't as new as the saint it look
They bury ministers there right next to straight crooks
And Nas told niggas they was shooting and they'd look
Niggas rhyme about banging, getting whooped on Facebook
Now put that on your wall, I put that on the wall
I shot-call and brawl quicker than Jon Wall
I'm killing these niggas, bought everything last year
And wasn't feeling these niggas. I mean I was numb last year
Wasn't feeling you niggas. Came back
To sell a few more mil on you niggas
Toast! I'm in the Phantom, nah nigga I ain't scared of no ghost
Cause all the dead rapper's albums are selling the most
[Hook]
[Verse 3 - Game]
Some say the 3rd verse puts niggas in a hearse
Since I was born Jay, guess I'm the Gift & The Curse
Lot of Bloods out here, but nigga I did it first
Still blood out here that's why I'm up in the church
Still repenting for my sins, but not all the way
Cause I just rode up in the Benz and handed homie the K
What he gon do with it? Probably run up on your crew with it
That's what I call rap beef, luckily I'm through with it
Now I just lean back, '72 with it
Sell it to a nigga down South, he act a fool with it
Back to them haters and the stool-pigeons
You're too busy tryna judge us stars, but how are you living?
[feat. Rick Ross]
I got a house on my face, custom made glasses
Lays on the [?], ashes to ashes, valee to vessel
Known as an Aston, the oz [?], homie, only you my absence
Let the nigger we gang members almost [?]
Not the boats but get your but like the [?]
My wrecken sales could never reflect my respect
What god damn death Jim for reverend [?]
Money bags back and forth how carry it on
[?] homies on my lawn, still I grieve on
As I'm now to my crucifix, tears in my eyes, smiling on the inside
Nobody cares what I feel like, no
Now it's six [?] next just to feel right, let's go
Carry on and my glasses, toast to competition
Ashed to ashes
See the [?] in the club, you know we got bottles
See the lambos out front, tell me we fucking models
Spin wheel nigger shit you can pop it into [?]
Making lane for the niggers that have never seen the leather
Red diamonds in the [?], red frames in the lenses
How you know yo all? Baby mama driving Benzes
Louis Vuiton house shoes somewhere on the road
Like a snitch nigger body, let this motherfucker flow
Champaign in my glass feeling like a boss
I'm in love with a phantom like fuck with the [?]
Louie [?] full of honeys, [?] at a purple, keep it g cause that's me
These rap niggers speak urkle, survival of the fittest,
Swimming in the dog seat world in my living room come and feed the sharks
[?] for my city, [?] would a fellow park, nigger rappers like New York
Ain't nowhere to park
That's why I got a chauffeur, I don't need a valee, head the game, watch it burn
Give it up to [?], [?] no bone in my body, nigger I salute you
You disrespect my hood I fuck around and shoot you
You got the well running round throwing up bees
Niggers saying su wu like they're fucking chinese
Ass [?] when I'm blowing on embrace, topped down blow a smoke go to fucking interstate
See the [?] in the club, you know we got bottles
See the lambos out front, tell me we fucking models
Spin wheel nigger shit you can pop it into [?]
Making lane for the niggers that have never seen the leather
Red diamonds in the [?], red frames in the lenses
How you know yo all? Baby mama driving Benzes
Louis Vuiton house shoes somewhere on the road
Like a snitch nigger body, let this motherfucker flow.
[Hook]
Hood morning
Hood morning
Hood morning
Hood morning
[Verse 1]
No motherfuckin' typo
That's like Westside, Compton with no psycho
That's like Beverly Hills with no lipo
Uncle chucky
Will you read us a bedtime story please huh please
Alright
You kids get to bed ill get the story book
Heeeeereeeee weeee go
Slam the impala door and want do ya see
Some niggas hangin on the fence lookin at me
I had phat red laces in my addidas
Big chain around my neck like mardi grass
So I stepped up to them (?) far from here
One nigga lifts his shirt then yells out "yeah"
So I turned around quickly and jumped in my car
I was about to hit the switch then I thought like "nahh"
So I reached under my seat, and I grabbed my shit
It was a chrome four five with the kung fu grip
Stuffed it inside my dickies as I jumped out the car
Kept my hand on the trigger as I walked to the star
One nigga walks in, then here comes two
"what did you do"
I shot!
Are you crazy fool?
One nigga hit the ground then the other two scrammed
Now the cops are outside
Well ill be damned
It was 7:15 on my rolex watch
And I cant do the time that my rolex got
And like the hands on the clock, I went this way, thatta way
Ran around the corner, and that's when I threw my gat away
And impala passes, its my homeboy clyde
He gave me the hand signal, so I jumped in his ride
It was a clean six fo, orignal inside
With no key in the ignition
Whered you get this clyde?
Nevermind, I'm out, its a stolen whip
And I'm already runnin from the cops and shit
So I hopped out the car like the dukes of hazard
Then clyde yells out "you stupid bastard"
So I'm runnin though traffic and I almost get hit
I lost one of my shoes, its my airforce, shit
I'm haulin down the street with one shoe on
Walked straight into some niggas with all blue on
I only ran 30 blocks, how I end up in long beach
Cause in california the gangs in arms reach
He seen my red strings so he punched and caught me
So I knocked his ass out and took his boy out his barklys
I ain't seen these since 92'
I'm feelin like a bad boy without the shiny suit
Here the cops come, shit, so I hide behind a honda
(?)
In the car kissin (?)
Little did he know he was suckin my dick
I start bangin on the window, I don't mean to disturb
But chris can you drop me off downtown, on third
He said sure, waddup game hop in
He was bangin slick rick then I got an idea
Before we get to third drop me off right here
So I can walk inside the mall and cop some new gear
As I walked into the store they could see I was in a rush
So they bought me some jeans, a t shirt and fresh chucks
Walked out the store, looked left, oh no
Ran back in the store, here comes the 5-0
So I ran real quick, made a move to the back
And knocked a cute bitch into a polo rack
Said sorry, jumped over her and fled to the back door
Then I kicked the shit open, you wont believe who I saw
Its chris in handcuffs, pointin at me
And the cops made him chase me before they let him free
One cop tried to grab me, and the other one missed
I got away with more time, and they both got pissed
Ran straight out the mall, spotted this blue coupe
'dogg pound' on the plates, that's gotta be snoop
So I ran up the car and said yo snoop
The cops got me on the run need a ride (?)
Hell yeah bigg snoop, little homie hop in
He dropped me off in compton, that's when my story ends
Now this ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
This another story about the wrong path
I had a big day, so I reclined my seat
It was a 20 minute ride to the C.P.T
Walked straight up to my house, pulled out my key
Its my girl playin (?)
You ain't gotta say bye bye, baby this is hello
Put your hands in the sky, 'cause that's where we go go
You know I like you so I gotta put a ring on that
You the one that I wanna put everything on that
Let's go, baby this is hello
Come on let's ride
She used to wake up to The View
Now she wake up with a view
Used to wake up to a kiss
Now she wake up to a shoe
Used to dream about millions
Now she workin' with a few
Used to know one Porsche, now she know two
Chanel handbags stuck to her like glue
Minks and chinchillas, whole closet like a zoo
Agent Provocateur, Louis and lots of Dior
All her friends wearing Gucci so she don't rock it no more
Every time we in Jimmy Choo, they gotta lock up the store
Walk out with boxes galore, next week she cop her some more
Alexander McQueen 'cause she my queen
Spent an Aston Martin on the ring, so you ain't gotta,
You ain't gotta say bye bye, baby this is hello
Put your hands in the sky, 'cause that's where we go go
You know I like you so I gotta put a ring on that
You the one that I wanna put everything on that
Let's go, baby this is hello
Come on girl, let's ride
Soon as them butterfly doors go up on that Ferrari
She step outside the car on there, stumble into Bulgari
Fall in that Y-cell, try it on, you fly as hell
Don't really like it, but I'm buying it, might as well
Have her own reality show, no drama
Grab your girl, we're shooting real housewives in the Bahamas
2-piece Hermes, Bottega Veneta flats
I heard Diddy out here so you know where the party at
(We on)and I ain't even gotta ask twice
'Cause when we hit the room she up and down like the gas price, damn
Got chills thinking of last night
I swear you was a goddess in your past life so,
You ain't gotta say bye bye, baby this is hello
Put your hands in the sky, 'cause that's where we go go
You know I like you so I gotta put a ring on that
You the one that I wanna put everything on that
Let's go, baby this is hello
Come on girl let's ride
Girl I know you wanna get away
This hotel room, that's where it goes down
And I know we never get away
Just give me a couple minutes and I'm in it
We all over the table, ain't no problem with you sweating on me
And I ain't pulling out, I'm tryna have fun
I know you tryna have fun
You ain't gotta say bye bye, baby this is hello
And you ain't gotta front for your friends
You know I have your hat
And the Louis Vuitton I got for your birthday

And them bottles that we popped last Thursday
That was hello

I guarantee that you gon' tell the other man he need to get lost
And girl you know you dealing with a veteran, I'll beat that down

Pull up in Pakistan like I'm Evel Knievel
Air raid Jackson, I stay spaced out
Never lay my Jesus piece face down

25 to life
Mama told me to stay away from them niggas
Mama told me she had a K for them niggas
Mama told me she go to pay for them niggas
But my grandmother told me that she would pray for them niggas
They just young black and ignorant lusting over models and them Benjamins
Got the game twisted (like what?) licorice
When I was rocking lottos moving packs up on McDonalds
She was looking for me, pulled up in that old El Dorado
I was running around with Chase, chasing new black wheels
Why would I do that still? That's what got 2Pac killed
But I use that still 'cause I won't do that deal
Screw the muzzle in potatoes of that new Mac Mill
What did I learn? Nothing, my papa smoking sure and bluffin'
Beating on my moms like her head was a percussion
Tat-tat my four five knocking on your window
She said there would be days like this
Pharrell, drop the instrumental
Yes sir
[Chorus: x2]
I know I must go and I don't know my way
Still somehow I know I'll end up where we all came from
(From my mama's womb)
Crack a Swisher, crack the fifther
Hennessy pouring like Niagara Falls
Used to watch Magic, he showed me how to ball
Mom's working late night, to get a plate right
Had some older brothers, all we did was smoke and play-fight
Wish I could go back to them days 'cause streets don't play right
Some niggas hard, other niggas was the Kid 'N' Play type
But that didn't stop me from pretending I was Apollo from Rocky
Working on my dip-game, now nobody wanna box me
Pick and choose, stick and move
So many dudes ended up with sleeping bags on late-night news
But not my mama's son, going around the hood for serving customers
She yapping in my ear, but it's louder than the muffler
What I didn't listen to, I wish I would've trusted her
Wish I had a shovel, be digging both of my brothers up
Like, "Here hug em ma, one last time"
Put a chain on both of them niggas, they get one last shine
[Chorus]
Put your block down, recognize a king 'cause it's my town
Word to my mother you can throw up your rock now
Got off the beef shit 'cause I ain't tryna see my mama in all-black
Right there, crying over hard facts
Now she gotta turn in all her cars and get her house back
Never, she carried me for nine months so she can have whatever
Clever, she taught me how to shoot Berettas, told me that I'd be a king
So R.I.P. to Coretta, if you don't understand that
Then refer to my letter, while I sprinkle
Niggas with platinum, from my last album
Got the check, so I signed on the X like Malcolm
Riding through the hood, you hating niggas like, "How come?"
That niggas Game got it, heard he selling talcum
Either way, playboy, check it, this is the outcome
You might not like it, but my mama psychic
Why you niggas twisted like the top of a sidekick?
[Chorus]
ER nigger fuck your baby momma
Fuck all of her friends than I not I am a not
Follow my on twitter nigger dont be that bidder if thats your girl
Nigger I for . got stabs on my . that dont mean I cant get her naked
Check it 45 for my necklace . so reckless tell your girl I got a hard dick for red lips
Tell her the sexiest tell her the text is tell her to pick me up in the ex shit
Not for long graduated for Stanford so our . came strong
She look good in dress used to see her in the down
Get her so wet she could . a bomb ass so white make a nagger wanan tap
Pussy so tight feel my hand like a snack .almost fell in love but a nigegr had to snack back
. Mister . you aint like me catch my with a . ice tee
You aint heard . put your ass down like the six four round . I only got one night in this town
Chorus
Stars are .
Time to put the bottle in the ice
. one night I can sleep it right
Girl tell me what you want
Everything comes with a .
I just want a little time maybe .
I have been waiting for this moment all my life
Give it to me how I want you know how I want it

Got 3 thousand hits . mother fuckers
Now I am rocking with the greatest . blood diamonds

Tell your bitch . get on these hoes . all I wanna do is . with the crew

Chorus
Stars are .
Time to put the bottle in the ice

Girl tell me what you want
Everything comes with a .

I have been waiting for this moment all my life
Give it to me how I want you know how I want it
Bad intentions nigga
Fucking with the wrong one
Call Dre tell that nigga I'm on one
Aftermath nigga we blaze cuban cigars
Drive foreign cars into the stars
Fuck bitches at our leisure
Stuff dick inside they throat til they have seizures
Hoes down, B's up
Roll the trees up, Smokey Robinson
Start trippin, I like his jewelry, then I'm robbin son
Fuck a platinum plaque nigga hood with it
Bouncin that impala down the shore like what's good with it?
I'm a made man, I wear J's and
I been around more rocks than a fuckin cave man
I done sold it and bagged it
I done drove it and crashed it
Fucked my credit up smashin the Ashton
FYI nigga I got a magnum,
Only time I been punked was by Ashton Kutcher
I'm a motherfuckin butcher
Leave me around anything white and I'm a cook it
I be all up in the kitchin
No need for an apron, playboy
I'm a professional, I'm cakin playboy
The last real D-boy up in this rap shit
Chrome 24s with the fat lip, call the shits? cash
? Fuckin with the bomb squad
Dismantle any MC for free, you been warned god
Church, Higher power
Impala sittin clean like it took 5 showers
Nigga I'm the G.A.M.E. so don't you tempt me
Your chest'll be full and my clip will be empty
I'm simply one of the most raw niggas in this shit
Why you think that I got in this shit?
Paid for my momma house, bout 700k
Can't stop smokin but I'm down to a blunt a day
Yay, I mean yayo
On the block sun up sun down like where the day go?
We come through chargin nigga like San Diego
Seventeen chargers, couple of em same color but the shit is ok though
Cause all my niggas on the payroll get caught slippin, get a halo
And I ain't talking bout the x-box
Niggas let the tech knock
Welcome to the real life, black ops
Where it's still fuck the police, white and black cop
And we ain't killin Jonny, no
Nigga give em an ass shot
Put him on injured reserve
Tie my number twelves up and then I give him the bird, word
That's how I get down, all you rap niggas floppin
Who talkin shit now? only Drake and Yay worth coppin
I take a hiatus, spend a little time gamblin in Vegas
Come back to back runnin faster than five Lakers
So mother fuck a hater and his family
About to finish the R.E.D. album up in Miami
Lebron can't stand me, cause I got this purp in my cup
24s on the truck, Laker game nigga what?
Ballin, Jim Jones voice probably with the Byrd Gang
See the chrome boy? and my mother fuckin home boys
But I'm from Cali not to be confused with Khaled
He say that we the best but I'm the best that's valid
And before you try to say that that's a diss,
I was up at Khaled's house two days ago bitch
Sippin on a Long Island ice tea with a white bitch
That was just as bad as Ice-T's, but she's not the wifey
The wife be at home with the kid's
Look at them and see how a motherfucker live
24 cars, 5 and a half cribs, I was spending money like goin broke was the shit, shit.

Yeah, it's time to wake up
Wake up and cake up

Broadcasting live from the left coast
The land of la la, movie stars, pimps, playas, hustlers and purse straps
It's w balls, the station that murders them all with platinum hits
And this is dedicated to the ladies who love giving that sloppy toppy
Go 'head and pull that foreskin back, hold on tight

You requested it and the documentary 2 is in your ear
And I am the dj that is gonna sock some soul to your ass
Not the dj that can save your life

About to shoot a rope down your throat, it's dj easy dick
Killing you softly with intoxication
And a song that's guaranteed to put some dip in your hip
Right now you're listening to the sweet melodic sounds
Of the game and the homeboy deion
So kick back, get your mind right, red cups in the air
Sip on some of that gin and juice like it ain't no thang
And puff on some of that la confidential strain, yeah
Pouring up the gin and juice (gin and juice)
Got a nigga feeling loose (got a nigga feeling loose)
Can you roll this blunt for me (yeah, yeah)

And speaking of the game, he gon' be stopping by the studio later on
But right about now, I'ma hit you off with another slapper off the documentary 2

Right here on the station that fades them all, w-balls

Fiends stealing cause they can't get a fix, my nigga
Sharing needles, passing AIDS and shit, my nigga

I don't want this Benz or this truck no more
I started off doing this shit cause I love this shit, Blood
Seeing the homie slap box, I love this shit, Blood
Sitting in my Impala like I love this shit, Blood
Weren't never 'bout a dollar, I just love this shit, Blood
Scrapping after school, Compton high wasn't bool
Could have went to Centennial but I love this shit, Blood

I told you bitches, I was gone Ja Rule you niggas
Now nobody even want shoes from you niggas
Seen them shits at Wal Mart for ten bucks
Y'all niggas soft, you belong on Nip Tuck
My joints is potent like some mothafuckin herb
You ain't gutta, you flutter like a hummingbird
You lost every beef except Murder Inc
Mumbling on tracks that you wanna murder me
Brought a glock to ya house, Security lockin me out
Wet ya, you can get ya block knocked in a drought
You niggas ain't nothing but a team of cops and a mouse
And you ain't getting hoes you stay wit a cock in ya mouth
Chorus 2x
You niggas ain't competition
Being a bitch nigga is against my religion
You can't play the Game
So there's no way you can win it
You rap about shit you ain't never do
You ain't even smoke when we chilled wit Snoop
You and your girl Banks actin like Regina George
Talking bout "Omg Game you can't sit with us no more!"
(Fuck outta here) all I need is some Henny and my tech
Fuck being friends, I put the semi to your neck
I keep a Billi on my neck, ask David Brown
Quick to fade a clown, who's Mr Potato Head now?
You niggas is industry pawns, I'm the Bishop like Juan
My bitch look like Mulan, yo bitch look like RuPaul
Get off my dick, before I slaughter yo unit again
I'm the reason fans never press play on ya music again
Your flow garbage, you act like a ho with postpartum
Slay you with no problem, bump Ghost Unit in the lowrider
Cubes in the chain, I put the tool to ya brain
I make this look Eazy like E, ain't nothing new To the Game
Chorus 2x
It's motherfuckin' Game time!
Six pounds of chronic on my grandma coffee table
That's how you remember it, that's how I remember it
Yeah, dip into the liquor store, .9 in my khaki's
Crips tryna get at me, my red Impala bumping like acne
My city a trap me
Been shot, robbed, stabbed, chased home, socked out
Jabbed by esse's, cops, degenerate niggas with rags
Disintegrate niggas went into me, dome shots like Kennedy
Slugs trippin' with Henessey, got murderous tendencies
And if you don't know where the fuck they got me from
Martin Scorsese when I pull out my gun
Scarface, car chase, tell me how your blood taste
Ask your baby mama, she'll tell you how a blood taste
Basket case, still I'm back with Dre, wait I never left
Run up in Beats, "Bitch pass the safe! Compton"
Produced by a billionaire in this motherfucker
Still smoking, Dre we need a ceiling in this motherfucker
Compton!
They're killing in this motherfucker
They're drilling in this motherfucker
Lock the door, they're stealing in this motherfucker
No chains, no reins, this my home
Nigga this hub city, no fly zone
Niggas pull out burners, start breaking like turbo on ozone
Crack fiends on the back streets
Where the tracks lean and the needles lay
And switchblades, if you bitch made
Put chili all on your Frito Lay's
Where we dream of Montego Bay
But all we got is the swap meet
Where the cops meet, go bang bang
Leaves blood stains on the concrete
And I'm the only nigga bumping Mobb Deep
Cause I mob deep down that side street
I'm a west side rider, [?] gats on collars
Don't hate me, better get your dollars
I be on Rosecrans with a Glock in both hands
Leaning on that bro hand
Flame dump like a co-tail with my name on it
Another day in Compton, the thrill is high
Know somebody's watching, but I don't know why
Feel the fire burning, it touches the sky
Feeling coming at you, I won't die tonight
So I get by, I get by
I get by, I get, I get by
Cause it's just another day in Compton
Here we go again
Ten years later
You know what man? Uhm
(I wanna know)
Fuck it
Ayo C
Give me that Jamison and that pickle juice
Thank you
I got some shit on my mind
(I wanna know)
My little nigga Frog dead, dog
They shot my little nigga in his head, dog
You heard what the fuck I just said, dog?
Walk inside my closet like fuck everything red, dog
If you seen your best friend stiff, you would cry too
Sometimes I don't even wanna be a Piru
Then I think about it like, fuck everything blue
Who killed my motherfuckin' brother?
(I wanna know)
Who killed G man too? The shit I seen men do
If I told you, I'd have me floating in cement shoes
See Compton ain't shit really
And I've been at the bottom of the pits, feel me?
I done had some real niggas try to kill me
Fake niggas in my crew
Crip niggas more loyal than a few of my Piru
I done been shot, had a surgery or two
Above the rim like Pac, I'm like birdie at the troops
I can't lie, every time I see Suge my heart beat
Cause I don't know if I should dap him or let the hawk speak
Wilmington and Brazil, nigga them my cross streets
And who gon' take it from me?
They think they know me
But they do not know me
'Cause I do not know me
Who killed my homie?
I wanna know names
Click-clack explain
I can kill you but ain't nothing gon' change
But I might do it anyway
You gonna die any way
I'm gonna die any way
We can go any day
It can be any day
But for you
Today is the day
Today is the day
I was playing Madden then I heard a knock
Everybody know I got shot but this for niggas that forgot
Sometimes I thank God that I got set up
When you shot twice in the chest, it's kinda hard to keep your head up
Suspect one: the homies never came to see me
Suspect two: Red hid my gun behind the TV
Suspect three: I was beefing with this Crip in my apartment
Shit started cause we fought and he couldn't see me
There's usually ten niggas in our dope spot
Cold ass night, I'm like a janitor at Wing Stop
I usually play Xbox with the gun cocked
I'm cool with taking mine, but I took other niggas' gunshots
Chest wide open, I'm tryna fight, but my lungs not
Hole in my chest bout the size of a Kumquat
I know who shot me cause I shot them
But who set me up? I ain't tripping but
(I wanna know)
They think they know me
But they do not know me
'Cause I do not know me
Who killed my homie?
I wanna know names
Click-clack explain
I can kill you but ain't nothing gonna change
But I might do it anyway
You gonna die any way
I'm gonna die any way
We can go any day
It can be any day
But for you
Today is the day
Today is the day
Let me tell you how I met my nigga Wack
Shit, he ain't always have a nigga back
When I met him, he was standing behind Suge
And everything is all good when you banging for your hood
Compton
That nigga Wack got my number and came through
Now let me tell you the type of shit the Game do
He walked in the booth where I was spitting
Gave him ten thousand, couldn't even finish his fuckin' sentence
I ain't owe him shit, but real recognize real
Now we like two red-nosed Pits
Cross him, you gotta cross me
And don't forget about where my nigga AR be
He be in the cut, that niggas nuts, don't give a fuck
Love his nigga Game to death, and he mean it from the guts
Blood, what's up? Which one of you dumb mothafuckas wanna try us?
(I wanna know)
Tie on a bandana, then we lay him out
Fighting over two colours in the crayon box
It's no love
It's no love
40 ounces in my cup, I'm po'd up
We out here killing each other, but so what?
Keep it up and there's gon' be no Crips and no Bloods
Nigga take a look around, the crack game has slowed up
The government versus the people, now tell me
Who rules the world with only one desire?
I don't believe there's anything higher
Rather get it now than to read about the outcome
I'd rather have the crown, than a ribbon or medallion
And oh my days, I guess it's okay
If I lay up in the shade with my [?] in the mattress
But be at the course if I have to use patience
I'm shooting a premature dream in the napkin
Battling the evils in the flesh that I'm wrapped in
Waiting for my eagle, but the seagulls are distracting
What's happening, niggas? Mm
What's happening? Hm
What's happening?
What's happening? Mm
What's happening?
Mm, yeah
What's happening? My nigga just died from Aids
What's happening? ISIS throwing grenades
What's happening? White boys shooting up a church
What's happening? My nigga 2-2 just got some work
What's happening? You can get it if you got it, nigga
But I ain't got it, nigga, I'm just a solid nigga
Who run Compton, fuck bitches and flick Impala switches
Even if I was born blind, you niggas couldn't stop my vision
Right on time with mine thanks to them old Doc prescriptions
West side flourishing again, this what 2Pac envisioned
Obama freeing lifers, that was locked in prison
El Chapo said he ran the world, and they forgot to listen
Not me, nigga, one split second, I say "Fuck rap"
And if I ran into El Chapo, he had work as one his captains
And gave me 100 bricks and said "Migo, get it bracking"
I walk into a Mexican Mafia meeting like
What's happening? Pac's gone, Brenda's still got a baby
What's happening? Lost ones in the land of the crazy
What's happening? You can have a bad bitch in a Mercedes
But that don't make your basic ass Beyonce or Jay-Z
What's happening? Obama 'bout to move out the White House
What's happening? Couple hood niggas 'bout to roll them dice out
What's happening? Is you gon' let me use your EBT card (yeah)
I wonder if I could slide it for commissary, yah
Ain't it a shame?
Another lost one running again
(You know I bust my thang for you)
You do the same old thing that your brothers did before you
Planning your whole life under concrete in the soil
Just a continuation, I wonder where you get your game from
If I know anything it's that my old head taught me all alone
And it's a cold game, better get your coat, get your snow chains, man
It's a chess game full of kings and pawns
Black and white squares, just depends what side you on
(What side is you on?)
I want a red '64 Impala with them things on it
Black out inside an abandoned crack house
Only thing from last night was dead bodies and glass pipes
That was the age 4, and by the age 10
They opened up the caged doors and let the fucking beast out
Fuck my auntie couch, I'm 'bout to take the street route
And get my shit the gangsta way, cause I can't be no Steve Stoute
I'm too Nas for these niggas, I got a surprise for these niggas
Potato cooking on the barrel, I bring the fries to these niggas
Funeral hall, casket fit to the size of you niggas
Chrome 45, no lie, come say goodbye to you niggas
Sway got all the answers, Kanye lied to you niggas
I don't even wanna be in no top 5 with you niggas
I break ties with you niggas, then pay tithes for you niggas
Los Angeles king, I will no fly zone you niggas
Take a caravan and Impalas and drive to you niggas
Close one and aim, Fetty Wap's eye to you niggas
Ain't it a shame?
Another lost one running again
(You know I bust my thang for you)
You do the same old thing that your brothers did before you
Planning your whole life under concrete in the soil
Just a continuation, I wonder where you get your game from
If I know anything it's that my old head taught me all alone
And it's a cold game, better get your coat, get your snow chains, man
It's a chess game full of kings and pawns
All I ever wanted was to ride my '64 down 'Shaw
Uh, I'ma spit them verses for my niggas
Dreams coming true, don't it always paint a perfect picture
Remember me? Like father, like son
Had a million dollars 'fore I was 1
'Cause my daddy hustle
We good now
'Cause my daddy hustle
We out the hood now
'Cause my daddy hustle
Remember me? Like father, like son
Had a million dollars 'fore I was 1
'Cause my daddy hustle
We good now
'Cause my daddy hustle
We out the hood now
'Cause my daddy hustle
Winning like Steph Curry in the chip though
Used to be the only one, now I'm the big bro (I'm here too)
Know my daddy schizo, don't mess with his kids yo
Me and my brother tight (yeah), we like the Klitschkos
I love you daddy
Ten years later, I love you too sons
I do life in the box if they ever fuck with my two sons
You're my lil' man, I remember the first day you came out
Your lil' face, your big nose, your lil' feet, your lil' hands
You turned one, come in the room wobbly, lil' stance
And every time I walked in the house he used to do this lil' dance
On the cover of the album with them Chucks on
You cried for 6 hours, your mama in here going nuts on me
She said you had enough, I said we having fun
All babies cry when they're one, my career had just begun
And so did being a daddy
Car seat in my Escalade, you want me in the Caddy
Playing Like Father, Like Son, looking in the back seat
He don't look nothing like his mama if you ask me
On the first album Busta Rhymes did the hook
Now he can do it for himself, watch him and his uncle cook
Buss
I'm glad you grew up to becoming everything you could be
That's all I wanted for you young'n, like father, like son
And in the end I'm glad you only turned out better than me
I hope you know I love you young'n, like father, like son
Your daddy told you it was coming
Coming, your day was coming, I told you
Now daddy's here just keep on running
Running, just keep on running, I tell you
I wanna thank my baby mamas Tiff and Eliska for everything
Y'all deserve the world, I wasn't worthy of no wedding ring
It ain't be one day since I met you I wasn't there for you
Wasn't husband material, but you know I really cared for you
And I know you remember that time when he was 5
All these tours taking the toll, I can see it in his eyes
So I stopped tours, stopped rapping, didn't give a fuck about
Nothing that happened after recording The Doctor's Advocate
Catching up with my son, cause ain't nothing more important
Than walking inside the Footlocker, copping them matching Jordans
Helping him with his jumper, the day he turned 9
I asked him what he want for his birthday, he said to spend some time
So we kick it, that's my best friend, I don't have to get married
He still my best man, and that's forever
Anybody can be a daddy, just bust a nut and leave
But I'm a father, and I'ma be everything he need and more
I'm glad you grew up to becoming everything you could be
That's all I wanted for you young'n, like father, like son
And in the end I'm glad you only turned out better than me
I hope you know I love you young'n, like father, like son
Your daddy told you it was coming
Coming, your day was coming, I told you
Now daddy's here just keep on running
Running, just keep on running, I tell you
Every time I get in this booth
I'm reminded ten years ago I did it for you, had this vision for you
And I know your daddy get in trouble sometimes
But I'ma stay up out this prison for you, I mean
You all my seed, lil' brother and both of your sisters
You all I need like Method and MJB
And I know I be wildin' sometimes, you told me ("Breathe daddy") (1,1, 2,2, 3,3, 4,4)
Furthermore, I'm try'na stay outta trouble just for my sons
Even though it feel weird leaving my house without a gun
I just gotta do it, cause they might grow up and do this shit
Just cause they father do it, fuck with my kids and six Bloods
Jumping out a Buick, understand Puff choking that man for Jus
I'ma do my stuff even if I land in fucking cuffs
For every nigga out here without a kid
Have one and that's gon be the best shit you ever did
One
Turn the beat up, yeah
New york, New york, wake up LA
Wave hi to the Chi, let's get right today
I heard them lil' niggas takin' their life away
I heard a couple lil' niggas got life today
Is it farrakhan, buddha, or christ today?
She on her knees so she know what it's like to pray
She got religious so she doin' it twice a day
I strap up, no I ain't throwin' dice today
When you got money on yo head it's a price to pay
And it get cold in the hood, put your ice away
They locked rick ross up and they ain't give him no bail
But a cracker shoot a whole church up and it's "oh well"
Oh well, oh well
Hang him with a confederate flag in his cell
Let him sit there and rot 'til his body turns to bones
Just remember who casted the first stone
New york, New york, good mornin' LA
Say hi to the Chi, celebrate to the Bay
No hesitation like steph, shoot it right in your face
Cause I'm a golden state warrior strapped with a K
How's it land of the free, when we're trapped in a cage?
Some shit just never make sense like magic and aids
Some shit just never make sense like bashin' the gays
Obama must be in the city, it's traffic today
Niggas trappin' today just like back in the day
We like roc-a-fella records, we packagin' yay
And that dirty sprite 2 shit slappin' today
We got these niggas boxed in like cassius clay
And my feregammo belt where that ratchet stay
Cause the police killing too many blacks today
I wake up in the morning like who gon' pass away?
Who gon' blast today? who gon' have to pray?"
New york, New york
Good morning LA my nigga haze blew him and his wife away
When the last time you seen 2Pac?
I know who killed Pac, nigga
The police know who killed Pac, nigga
Suge Knight know who killed Pac, nigga
He died at the carwash, the world heard the shots, nigga
Then they killed Biggie, he just came through to visit
Rampart divison, Pirus ain't had nothing to do with it
So many niggas in caskets, then turned ashes
Some get shot, some Hussein Fatal in car crashes
I think it's a conspiracy theory, Illuminati
How Pac died and two months later they killed Kadafi
Then they killed Buntry, [L?] and Heron, they getting sloppy
LAPD, these niggas worse than the Nazis
And Pac was only 25, thuggin' as a youngin'
Sitting shotgun, I wonder if he seen them shots coming
Guess it don't matter, all the niggas buried, though
Wouldn't have never happened if Suge kept it real with Harry-O
Late night down Sunset, liking the scene
On a tour bus in St. Paul, riding to win
Don't know how it begin, every day was a new
When he was young, living life fast and rhyming his truth
And if crack had took a part of the homie's family tree
Lil' nigga he was talking 'bout was probably me
And him to know my life story and we not even meet
When we did, it was like we'd known each other for demon
When the last time I seen him, he was playing his tape
And he would lay the title Makaveli the Great
Smile for me, yeah, it's strictly for my niggas
Try to touch money, high on weed and liquor
Hoping God'll forgive us, we been stuck here in the Matrix
Dead before you dishonor, lil' nigga, when he face him
Whatever shit you killing with, you get you two Glocks
I guarantee that pussy shit'll stop
When the last time you seen 2Pac?
Last time I seen him was in the mirror this morning
Riverside, motherfucker
Maybe I should iron out my flag
Maybe I should put another crease in it
Maybe I should iron out my flag
If you gang banging who you beefing with?
I Know your baby never hurt nobody

To my dope then kicked in locked up in a strange land
So when they be like, "Slick, why we ain't see you on TV or nothin'?"
Shit, I'm still tryin' get off the gang injunction
'Cause when it come to this been, I'm a monster to your leaf
You can do a whole damu documentary on just me
Call it "The Life of a Hundred Percent Real Whooper"
They did it for the grams, moves and the hush
Gah damn
Maybe I should iron out my flag
Maybe I should put another crease in it
Maybe I should iron out my flag
If you gang banging who you beefing with?
I put the woop in the woop like my DLB's
All I know is VNG's and FTB's
I ran phase back to back, that's on STB
And if you claimin' you a blood, shit, you better know me
Big homie gave me a gun and said "It better be empty"
I was eleven years old with a motha'fuckin' fifty
I got love for certain niggas, I've been doing this since knee high Nehi
And you ain't a real blood if you didn't bang at the beehive
Westside AM, back in a straight jacket

Niggas hate me, Documentary on they shelf though
In this Impala, old school like some shell toes
Had a fake gold chain, but don't nobody else knows

Compton
Don't trip on me, don't trip on me
Nigga don't trip
Don't trip blood, I make it rain in Compton like it's a strip club
I grew up on Santana block, that's where the Crips was
My mama house was in the middle of the street
How was a nigga supposed to get to school
I hopped every backyard on my block
'Till I got to Elm Street, took the rag out my sock
And I could have been a Crip but I ain't like blue that much
All Crip school, I ain't really go to school that much
I was selling crack on Elm, bagging up sacks on Elm
With the ratchet in my boogie jacket giving you the facts on Elm
King frog and big face they had my back on Elm
We was fighting over territory with the T Flats on Elm
I had to scrap on Elm, that's how I got my stripes
Air Max 95s not a scratch on my Nikes
2016 motherfucker don't you pull it
'Cause I made it out of Compton with a stab wound and five bullets
Don't trip on me, don't trip on me, nigga don't trip
'Cause I'm bool like that, I'm bool like that
I'm bool like that, yeah I'm bool like that
They say "Game, why you always act a fool like that?"
'Cause I went to Compton High Crip School like that
I was Blood and I ain't really like blue like that
They was Crippin they ain't give a fuck who like that
Them niggas jumped me why they have to do a 'ru like that
Nigga went and got the homies and we flew right back
They see like that, we be like that
We trip like that cause LA sick like that
We Blood like that, we Crip like that
The blunt lit like that, we out
When you ready, lemme know
When you want it, lemme know
I got it
When you see me
Congratulate a nigga don't hate
Niggas will always be niggas (yep, true)
That's why I don't trip on these niggas
Would you?
Niggas is wild like gorillas that's stuck in that zoo (yep)
What happens when niggas unite and start making the moves
Don't trip
They say it started in the East where the apple was
But out West we be throwing them apples up
They say them Fruit Town niggas gon' ride tonight
They say them Tree Top niggas gon' ride tonight
They say them Grape Street niggas gon' ride tonight
They say them Bounty Hunter niggas gon' ride tonight
They say them 6-0 niggas gon' ride tonight
They say them Cedar Block niggas gon' ride tonight
Them 1-9-0 niggas gon' ride tonight
They say them Timberland niggas gon' ride tonight
They say them Campanella niggas gon' ride tonight
Who gon' ride tonight, who gon' die tonight
Started with a dollar and a dream
Started with a dollar and a dream
We did it for the West, motherfucker, like Kanye
Niggas get stretched out on [?]
Got three thousand stacks, I ain't talking 'bout Andre
I put it on your head, I ain't talking no toupee
See I stayed the same, ain't go weird like Lupe
Squeeze on his trigger like ain't no more toothpaste
(You ain't gon' do shit) Bitch, of course I is
You want this money, you gon' have to drive the course I did
I got that weight foundry, talking 'bout the Porsche out here
You in the nosebleeds, come down to where the cross-eyed is
How a nigga with a rojo rag end up in Soho
Bag, any bitch walking with a solo swag
You think you ballin' in that four do' Jag? Nah
In Tom Fords with a MK bag? nah
Give you a bird's eye view of the streets
Nigga, welcome to Compton, take you in Carson next week
Ab-Soul!
Started with a dollar and a dream and a pistol
On the corner rag hangin', slangin' crystal
I said you gangbanging let me see credentials
And when I pull this gun out you know how this go
Started with a dollar and a dream!
(Look at me now, look at me now)
Started with a dollar and a dream!
I was fathered by the bastards
Pardon my mannerisms
The Curtiss magnet that managed without the metal with him
How the hell I did it? I let God ad lib it
I put that on Leetwood, I ain't lying one sentence
Bitch, I started with a dollar and a dream
We went from helping old ladies with their groceries at Alpha Beta
For a couple quarters to a baby hustling something major
We had to grow up sooner or later, but
I'm so Del Amo, my mama still stay off Anna Lee
Carson across my belly, I prove you lost already
Roccett my big brother, Bishop let the door crack
Game took me on my first tour, now look where we at
In the studio getting paid to reflect on that
Documenting true facts
Not to mention this the Documentary 2 too
You do the addition in ballerina shoes
Enough with the clever raps, it's more important than that
I put my city on the map, nigga
Yeah, I really put my city on the map
I mean, when the last time you heard Carson on the track, nigga?
Let alone when they calling out stomping grounds on the West
I'll wait
Yeah, that's what I thought, I'm the best, nigga
This the new West, nigga, respect that
It's Top Dawg, all I'm missing is the red hat
But don't question what pocket I had left, my handkerchief
I'm guilty by affiliation, in many ways gangsta
But let me explain something, a paradox if you may
I threw all my fresh Supreme Chuck Taylors today
And then I got a call from Chuck Taylor, I'm saying
The game ain't changed, we still changing the game
Soul!
Started with a dollar and a dream and a pistol
On the corner rag hangin', slangin' crystal
I said you gangbanging let me see credentials
And when I pull this gun out you know how this go
Started with a dollar and a dream!
(Look at me now, look at me now)
Started with a dollar and a dream!
My first album was a set up
I was the little nigga Pac was talking to
When he said "keep your head up"
Cause he knew what I would be facing after his demise
Jayceon had to pitch them pies, better life than flipping fries
I'm the one the Crips despise
Move the Yay or kiss the sky, for having dreams that 50 died
Eulogy by Mary Blige
Hopped up in that enterprise, had to stop a genocide
Went from underdog to watching Top Dawg and Kendrick rise
Now tell me can I testify, pull over trying to rest for 5
On a block, no tint on the Wraith left these kids mesmerized
They ask me how I did it, how I got it
Say I'm king you looking brolic
I put them weights down start practicing lyrical exercise
Tell me who the next to die, probably who the next in line
They got me babbling ghost cause I'm the illest one alive
That's word to Pac, Pun, Biggie, why I stand as my city
It's wise to run a train, you couldn't fuck with me
Ever since I saved my coast, it's been born again
If I ain't shit then who the king of California then?
Who could out-rap me?
Now think about if the same nigga you bout to say can run up and out-strap me, yeah
Out-trap me, yeah, out-gat me
I mean think about it, exactly
Speaking matter-of-factly I'm down playing that actually
Call me Game I ain't one still I get paid like an athlete
Do the math after the math, Doc two in the bag
Lived up to expectations, Dre took me first in the draft
Now who the fuck want what
Nobody survives so look alive when them Impalas in the cut
Started with a dollar and a dream and a pistol
On the corner rag hangin', slangin' crystal
I said you gangbanging let me see credentials
And when I pull this gun out you know how this go
Started with a dollar and a dream!
(Look at me now, look at me now)
Started with a dollar and a dream!
I'm cooling in LA
The place where stars are born

And I-I-I-I-I, I got the city on lock if you wanna explore
And baby I been cooling in LA

All these girls got extensions, even with the long hair
Everybody tripping, we mix Ciroc with Patron here
Don't walk around alone here, everybody from a gang

Smoking on that purple rain

La-la-la-la-la-la
Baby when you coming to LA?
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
I'm from that big blue raggin', tip toe taggin'
Mustard and mayonnaise, with Daynas on the wagon
Brown paper baggin', baby mama naggin'
You're either skinny jeans, gucci belt or straight saggin'
Pleasure and agony, black jeans Cagney
The wood is the wood, but the hood is like a cavity
So much tragedy, rarely see clarity
I'm like a (?), charity, sincerely
Los Angeles, scandalous, handle us how?
We the ones you get your swag from, write that down
Home of the green leaf, watch out now
High school lesson, y'all can drop out now
California highway, California my way
I do it that way, then roll a fat jay
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, look at me in my Cadillac car
In LA
The place where stars are born
And it ain't never cold outside
Because the rain will never storm
And the stars ain't only in the sky
Because the stars lay on the floor
And I-I-I-I-I, I got the city on lock if you wanna explore
And baby I been cooling in LA
La-la-la-la-la-la
Baby when you coming to LA?
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

No refreshing these hoes, they keep shoppin'
Sunset droppin', chicken heads flockin'
No recess, my flows, there's no stoppin'
DeLorian rollin', pockets stay swollen
Drive down to (?), East Los is where I'm goin'
Cholo swagger, qe pasa wassup?
I'm rockin it, (inhale?)
LA native, LA Raider, LA Rams, motherfuckin' traitors
LA Clippers, LA Lakers, trippin' off Kobe, you the motherfuckin' greatest
LA Dodgers, finger to the Padres
East Los niggas sayin' chinga to madres
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, look at me in my fancy car
In LA
The place where stars are born
And it ain't never cold outside
Because the rain will never storm
And the stars ain't only in the sky
Because the stars lay on the floor
And I-I-I-I-I, I got the city on lock if you wanna explore
And baby I been coolin' in-
(Compton, Compton, Compton, Compton, Compton, Compton)
It's time to blackout, time to spit this crack out
Niggas been finding for this shit, Aftermath crackhouse
The way I spit, niggas'll think I pulled the mack out
I said the way I spit, niggas'll think I blew J-Lo back out
Still Compton nigga, fuck y'all thought I went on vacation?
Same nigga that used to break in houses and steal PlayStation's
I hate waitin'
I told Dre to put out Detox, or I'mma do it
This is that nigga, The Chronic mixed with embalming fluid
Bring your chin here blood, so I can put this lama to it
Disrespectful nigga, see this window? I send your mama through it
Do it for the coast, so we can toast to it
Who showed you all the Pirus? The SA's and how the Los do it?
Similar to how the vice lords and folks do it
You remember bump Jay, out west, I'm the closest to it
Put on for my city bitch cause I'm supposed to do it
Straight Outta Compton, I'm the fucken movie poster to it, nigga
(Compton)
Mitchel, we out Blood
(Woah? Ya dat)
Um, yeah palms sweating guess it's time for the murder
My nigga my nerve, I swerve left you dead on the curb
Tell his family get them black clothes
Any witness gets a 9 cold, could do this with a blindfold
I'm that player on the corner looking dry when it rains
Pimp a dollar out a pussy, I ain't trying to change
Far from average, I'm smoking this cabbage
Bottled teeth, joint karats, say cheese, make the cops freeze
Big cribs, four bars, living pipe dreams
You only gangsta through your bop screen
Might set the reason for the crime scene
Fill up the city with madness
We the reason the hearses left your hood and holding up traffic
Let the riddles do the scrapping, keep the gun in my fabric
Better pistol than them badges, you get dealt with the maggots
Heard drive-bys everyday
Seen homies die early age, though we still gang bang anyway
Uh, yeah, Figg side
Though we still gang bang anyway, uh
B's and them h's, tats on faces, Glocks with extendos
Chucking up the hood then throw like 80 out that window
The chopper make you limbo
Gotta keep them antennas up, moving down Central
Young niggas with skinnies, moving with them semis
Catch your ass leaving the club, murk you at Denny's
Squeeze till it's empty, it seems so unreal
'Til the gunfire got you using tables as a shield
East side, west side, niggas getting chastised
Dropping like fruit flies, we all know who die
We all go on Insta and get the whole rundown
A 15 second clip until he put the gun down
Know OG's who took more shots like diabetics
Had that MAC paint on your face like cosmetics
Chucking up big ass B's is my fetish
Type of shit that make you go brazy if I let it
Niggas got zippers, wheelchairs and prosthetics
Though we still gang bang anyway, uh
Hundred days, hundred nights, nigga
Let the K'ss scream 'til we see the red and blue lights, nigga
From the hoovers to the hundreds, nigga
From Kelly Park to Bounty hunters, nigga
(Watch out for the shooters)
Same age as the kids in Iraq now
LA Chiraq now, funerals is packed now
Preachers at the pulpit, Jesus is the background
Grandmother get shot walking out the church
How that sound?
Niggas don't really like it but we grew up in it
City of angels, belly of the beast get chewed up in it
Started as Black Panthers, everything power, everything pro black
Started off unified the FBI know that
A little coke sprinkled on tables but wasn't no crack
False imprisonment, huey P, Geronimo Pratt
Now close your eyes, listen to me, your mind'll go back
Picture us chained together under the boat, that's a Kodak
And since today is Thursday, let me hit you with a throwback
Stolen identities, God left us here without lowjack
Forced to find ourselves, forced to break up outta chains
Got tired of getting hanged so we started our own gangs
Tookie Williams (Crip), Sylvester Scott (Blood)
Seventy two Lil' Country caught a slug
And that was the first time a crip ever killed a blood
Now the shit is worldwide cause it is what it was
We know the history and we know the shit could end any day
Though we still gang bang anyway, uh

Y'all thought that shit was fine
Till that shit go (braow!)
I done lost my mind
Niggas is bout to find out
(Somebody gone die tonight)
Fuck the police
Shit, fuck the police
(It's about to be a silent night)
All this blood on the streets man, fuck the police
(When that crowd ignite)
And unite like "Fuck the police!"
(Better hug yo wife
Man fuck yo life!
Payback, payback)
I got these freak hoes clappin' their hands, stompin' their feet
Every now and then they put their mouth on me
But these days a G like me can't even call it
They ride dick until you sleep and then go through your wallet
Fake ass, bitch ass, thot ass, slut ass hoes
Workin' in secret Sunday, don't even wipe that pole
Dirty bitch, you done had a dick in every one of your holes
You a trick, you ain't shit and everybody knows
Bitch you don't even wash your rag
Let a nigga smash and you don't even wash your ass
Fuck you mean? You 'bout to go home and take a shower
That mean that pussy 'bout to be funky for a whole 'nother hour
Every night you let a new nigga nut in your shit
How you suck a nigga's dick with that cut on your lip?
You freak bitch, your baby daddy in the county doin' burpies
And you gave that nigga herpies
Bitch you ain't shit, bitch you ain't shit
Bitch you ain't shit, bitch you ain't shit
Everybody knows
Bitch you ain't shit, bitch you ain't shit
Bitch you ain't shit, bitch you ain't shit
Everybody knows, everybody knows
Bitch you ain't shit
Everybody knows, everybody knows
Bitch you ain't shit
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and sluts
She asked to hold 500, I let her hold deez nuts
Bitch what? You fuckin' niggas when you got cramps
Talkin' bout eatin' groceries, bitch you on food stamps
You gotta watch these hoes, they get your ass splattered homie
Never trust a bitch if she got the hood tattered on her
Brother ,he a gunner, got an uncle from the hunters
Two baby daddies, one from the 60s and one from the Jumpers
Make it even worse, her whole family's full of killers
After the funeral she right back to the followers and filters
She got a Range and a Benz
Doin' credit card schemes with her ratchet ass friends
Bitch just stole a TV from Target
Yellin' at her kids while Joseline and Stevie be arguin'
She blocked from Drizzy's page now she all on my dick
I hit her with a hashtag like (Bitch you ain't shit)
Bitch you ain't shit, bitch you ain't shit
Bitch you ain't shit, bitch you ain't shit
Everybody knows
Bitch you ain't shit, bitch you ain't shit
Bitch you ain't shit, bitch you ain't shit
Everybody knows, everybody knows
Bitch you ain't shit
Everybody knows, everybody knows
Bitch you ain't shit
Yeah, let's take 'em back
Uh huh
Comin' up I was confused, my mama kissin' a girl
Confusin' occurs, comin' up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committin' felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing ch-check out my melody
I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope
Four-four fingering, one of them gold ropes
Nanna told me if I pass I'll get a sheep skin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'll be dope
Tossed and turn in my sleep that night
Woke up the next mornin' niggas done stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothin' good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could
Hate it or love, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me
Hate it or love, the underdog's ontop
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me
I told Dre from the gate, I carry the heat fo' ya
First mixtape song, I inherited beef fo' ya
Gritted my teeth fo' ya, G-G-G'd fo ya (G-Unit)
Put Compton on my back when you was in need of soldiers
At my last show, I threw away my NWA gold
And had the whole crowd yellin' free Yayo
So niggas better get up outta mine
Before I creep and turn ya projects into Columbine
And I'm rap's MVP
Don't make me remind y'all what happened in D.C.
This nigga ain't Gotti, he pretend
Mad at us, cause Ashanti's got a new boyfriend
And it seems your little rat turned out to be a mouse
This beef shit is for the birds and the birds fly south
Even Young Buck can vouch, when the doubts was out
Who gave the West Coast mouth to mouth
Hate it or love, the underdog's ontop
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me
Hate it or love, the underdog's ontop
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me
From the beginnin' to the end
Losers lose, winners win
This is real, we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in
Is full of pressure and pain
I thought it would change
Its stayin' the same
How many hidden bowls is with'cha ya
When you had that little TV you had to hit on to get a picture
I'm walkin' with the snub, cause niggaz do a lotta slick talkin' in the club
Till they coughin' on the rug, ain't never had much but a walkman and a bud
My role model is gone, snortin' up his drug, bad enough they want me to choke
My boy just got poked in the throat, now its a R.I.P. shirt in my coat
Now I'm speedin' reminiscin', holdin' my weed hit never listen
If I see him then I'ma lift'em and maybe that'll even the score
And if not, then it'll be me on the floor
Hate it or love, the underdog's ontop
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me
Hate it or love, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me
I started out at fifteen, scared as hell
I took thirty off a pack and I made them sell
As a youth, man I used to hustle for loot
With that little deuce deuce and my triple fat goose
Sippin' easy Jesus rockin' the leases
My mama whipped me when she found my pieces
I look back on life and think God I bless
We the best on the planet so forget the rest
You know I'm still nice with my cook game
Look man, its a hood thing that's why I'm loved in Brooklyn
I handle mine just like a real nigga should
If I do some time, homie I'm still all good
Let me show what a thug bout born to die
I took the bullets outta 50, put 'em in my four five
And I ain't even got my feet wet yet
A seven figure nigga who ain't seen a royalty check
Hate it or love, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me
Hate it or love, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me
[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
Well, she's a freak show, don't you think she knows?
She's got that street flow, I still wanna hit it slow
She's got that heat on hold, bend the weed I smoke
Know she's a freak show, don't you think she knows?
[Verse 1: The Game]
I tell her, "Ooh-ah, ooh-ah, ooh-ah, ooh-ah"
Said she twerkin' for tuition, gon' do that, do that to that 2Pac, 2Pac
Now she don't wanna leave, I'm the one she wanna be wit'
I told her, "Go 'head, do that carousel on the dick"
She say her pussy sweet like caramel, oh, shit
Let me taste that, face where your waist at
Bad boy in the pussy, I'm a bring Ma$e back
Horse and carriage, Diddy, what it take?
That movie on the 6S, know I gotta tape that
Rich nigga shit, ri-rich nigga shit
Stop playin' wit' them lames, be a rich nigga bitch
Tom Ford denim, see the grip when I sit
That boy spit venom, make a nun turn tricks
No teeth, just tongue and some lips wit' the shit
Mustard on the beat, but it's some Ritz in this bitch
[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
Well, she's a freak show, don't you think she knows?
She's got that street flow, I still wanna hit it slow
She's got that heat on hold, bend the weed I smoke
Know she's a freak show, don't you think she knows?
Well, she's a freak show, don't you think she knows?
She's got that street flow, I still wanna hit it slow
She's got that heat on hold, bend the weed I smoke
Know she's a freak show, don't you think she knows?
Granada I'm falling under your spell
I am the God
El Chapo, I am the God
You know I get the kilos
Cincuenta por ciento
If you are not bilingual
Get the fuck up out of town, 'fore we run your ass down
Underground how I came out
Any nigga try to stop me let it hang out, let it bang, let it rain out
Yo soy el dios you adios nigga
(I am the God)
Seen a nigga chopped up on a Tuesday
While the club goin' up on a Tuesday
This is goons day, I can have Guadalupe
Come through and knock Donald Trump out his tupee
Now look at his brains all on the sidewalk
And tuck the .38 and jump on my skywalker
And whew I'm a rolla
Shotgun, Claudia, oh cholo
Only nigga walking through
Sinaloa with the blower red
Chuck Taylors on and you know it when I show up
It's a squad full of killers, squad full of hittas
Squad full of niggas that'll pull up, let it bark on a nigga
Hundred six shots bark on a nigga
Street sweeper wet the whole block up, no Noah's Ark on a nigga
Got two Glock 9s, two .45s, two Desert Eagles
And they fight together side by side
No juegues conmigo, tu sabes de mi
No Tony Montana, amigos y kilos
Mi casa es tu casa cuidado con el chico
Tu tienes la plata y yo tengo perico
I am the God
El Chapo, I am the God
Pinches policÃ­as (puto)
Jodiendo todo el dÃ­a (cabrÃ³n)
Que si llora tu familia
O mi madre y mi tia
I'm on a private jet with El Chapo, feet up
Sippin' Tecate bout to land for the re-up
Fuck the Montanas, we ain't got them trackin' devices
The feds they be watchin' and see us
Niggas wanna see us? Check the IG
I'm in the Villa throwin' blood up like an IV
Don't try me, Dej Loaf with the AK
600 million, 400 million from Dre Day, uh
Pablo Escobar in my hey-day, uh
Bringing off coke that's a payday, uh
On a private jet that's a mayday, uh
In South America on a vacay, uh
P on my snapback, choppin' grade-a, uh
None of these niggas ready for the melee, uh
Hundred cal make his body do the nay-nay
Leave a nigga face worse off than Shanaynay
I am the God, I've been tellin' you niggas
I got a bird and a chopper in the trunk
And a ki I will sell it to niggas
We can screw it and chop it
Machetes on deck, I will sever you niggas
Behind these bars, some El Chapo
Motorcycle out the cell on you niggas
Escuchame chinga tu madre, nunca me encontrarÃ¡s , so para de mirar
No me controlas , te controlo! Controlo a todos!
Me respetan! No se muevan, soy el Chapo y la cocina al agua
I am the God
El Chapo, I am the God
I just want you to come home
No matter if it's late at night
(I hear you talking)
I know you saying you working
But baby boy this feeling ain't right
(I'm just out here tryna get my money you know that)
Fuck that we got enough houses, enough cars
You done bought me enough jewelry
Tired of your shit my nigga you hitting
(You know I be at the studio and shit)
Nigga you lying, who you trying to run that game on?
Who you think I am? I'm not one of these thots you met at Playhouse
(I didn't say that)
I just rode by nigga, you wasn't at Dre house
Parked my shit at Ye house and hopped in the uber
Jayceon stop lying you fucking think I'm stupid
Nah look ain't nobody say that
You ain't complain when I bought that Maybach
Put you in Chanel, your friend Chanelle can't even say that
You wanted to see Rihanna I put you and your friends at the concert
Closet full of Giuseppe[?] you came a long way from Converse
Took you out that concord[?], put you in that Tom Ford
All this arguing I ain't got no time for it
You call my phone like fifty times
Don't do no shit like that
I was just fucking them girls
I was gon' get right back
Spinning around, spinning around
Spinning around, spinning around
It's the same old, we be going through the same old
Spinning around, spinning around
Pulling them down, taking them down
It's the same old, niggas get tired of the same old
Nigga you strapping up?
Yeah I'm strapping up, shit you acting up?
Yeah I'm acting up, nigga
You not gon' keep on playing me
You not gon' keep on playing me
Is it gon' be this bitch or your family?
I'll kill that bitch whole family (I fucking hate you!)
What your crazy ass shooting in the house for?
What yo dumbass ruining the house for?And what time you get home anyway?
Shit, about four
And that's what the fuck you sleeping on the couch for
I don't give a fuck, thug life I'm an outlaw
And the next bitch ain't nothing but a house call
Scrolling through my iPhone looking for my sidechick
This bitch always flipping pushing buttons like a sidekick
That's when I hop in my Jeep and pull it out the toxic
And while you gone, guess what?
I'll be bouncing on that sidedick, nigga
I guess you thought they stopped making real niggas when they made you
Shit, they stop making them, they stop making them
Guess she thought they stopped making real bitches when they made you
Shit, there's a few in the room and a couple in the Wraith too
Now she's explaining to you
That she's the baddest bitch to ever grace to pair of shoes
And if you are unable to find better you lose
And all this loud chirping that you consider rude
But when food is on the table
We may be arguing like the Cain and we Abel
Then we have some makeup love and we get back stable
Have a little girl I cut the cord from her navel
I guess it's just the way it goes down
Love is like a merry go round
I guess it's just the way it goes down
Love is like a merry go round
It all goes to game
Whether we dribble out this motherfucker
Wrap rock or riddle out this motherfucker
We gon' get up out this motherfucker
Same way that Venus did, Serena did, we them kids
Whitney was talking 'bout that's how it was
Before my brother caught them slugs and I watched coroners chalk him out
That ain't my brother in that box, what niggas talking bout?
Couldn't Paul Bearer cause I was too weak to walk him out
And that's real shit, I'm dedicated
Like Pac was to Jada before Jada met Will Smith
I'm already turnt up, chronic still burnt up
Fuck outta here, with all that lean and popping pills shit
Jump in my Impala get it hopping with a kill switch
I done been around the world, my life is like a field trip
I done been to Africa, seen niggas in Attica
Cops killing our youth, these numbers ain't adding up
Like that white boy sitting in a prison cell
Killed 9 people in a church, how he living still?
I couldn't understand, I spent hours with Farrakhan
Just begging him to let me be the millionth man
But some of these niggas just make you wanna kill a man
And let the .38 spin like a ceiling fan
Separate your body from soul, soul from Earth
Roll a blunt with your remains and then ash it in the dirt
Listen, you ain't a Christian cause you go to church
Listen, you ain't a gangster cause you got the work
A real gangster's one who take care of his whole family
Like me, even though my baby mama can't stand me
Her name tattooed on my neck, nigga it's branded
And my fucking kids tighter than Ray J and Brandy
Yeah, I give it to you so you understand
Fucking bitches took my family
Bye baby, rock-a-bye baby
No tears or sobs, baby, been listening to Nas lately
And I can't lie, baby, been missing them thighs, baby
But it's more to life than Gucci and Louis Vuitton, baby
It's more to life than tripping on lies, baby
Put feelings aside, baby, you Nicki Minaj, baby
One day we all die, baby
So I'd rather go hard, keep Cali alive, baby
Yeah, keep Cali alive, baby
Double entendre, nigga that's my baby
And don't nobody father kids like me
Word to Kevin Hart, take care of they rib like me
I made fucked up decisions but don't let 'em crucify me
I'm still the same nigga on my California ID
Yeah, Compton nigga
Blame Dre, it's his fault that I'm a monster, nigga
I was selling crack in west side Bompton, nigga
Yeah I can rap, but I ain't ask for no sponsors, nigga
I was light skin and young Klay Thompson, nigga
15, had guns like Contra, nigga
Now the call me bipolar, big contradiction
This The Documentary 2 without Doc's prescription
Motherfucker
Let me know if you're feelin' lonely
Cause ain't no real niggas out here
Ye what these niggas start hummin' out their mouth with?
Bunch of bullshit, weak ass albums
Bunch of lil' niggas tryna copy our style
When we originated this, whole mothafuckin' album had hits
That's why we up in the Ritz
That's why I'm up in your bitch, head honcho
Get you killed pronto, wearin' red now, El Segundo
Bail long as Alonzo Mourning
Kill a nigga in his Monte Carlo like Alonzo
Sold records, sold crack, nigga, recognize
For the record, I've been wreckin' shit since '05
No lie, J's on
Take these mothafuckas off and throw the Ye's on
Rewind, J's on
Take these mothafuckas off and throw the Ye's on
Yeezy, tell these niggas that they is slaves
Master want you on red carpet like yesterday
You a house nigga, I'ma get away though
Come back kill master ass like Django
Most you niggas just rapping for the fame though
I start rapping to get the fuck out this durango
What goes around comes around how that saying go?
Documentary 2, no 50 keep the change hoe
Feelin' lonely
Let me know if you're feelin' crazy
I guess all that stuff they told me
In my life was extra shady
I should've kept 'em waitin'
Say hello to the mula
I'm on top, no lie
Say hello to the mula
I'm on top, good night
Back like I never left, nigga I'm on my second breath
And I got another track from Yeezy
How'd you do that? Like Eric Wright said Eazy
Pull up in my cool whip, I don't give a fuck about it
Leave it at the valet, I ain't fucked up about it
I'll call an Uber, nigga, I'll fuckin' shoot a nigga
I got a white bitch that blow like a tuba, nigga
I just got a new crib, I just got a new Wraith
I just got cooler than LL Cool J
I just got a new gun, squeeze it like some toothpaste
I, I
Spit in the face of a coward
Shit on anybody ever try to take ours
Ye why that nigga's face so sour?
Cause that slick mouth got him wet up like a shower
Now what you know about power?
What you know about dreams?
What you know about freestylin' versus
Shelter outside of Nike Town without a dollar in your jeans
Huh, niggaz think they got the game sewed, yeah right
I'm air tight, fresh in them Air Nikes
If the Navy outside, I might be there
Black hoodie, black 9, black wifey airs
Rock guns like Caddy trunks, keep a spare
You see the lump under the Iceberg fleece and gear
And when the beef cook, I'ma put the piece to your head
And if you see a white truck that mean yo' sheets is dead
Then I'm goin' goin', back back
To the block to dump the bucket and jump in the drop
Niggaz know I'm good with the glock, they call me Chick Hearns
'Cause if the game on knot, I'm callin the shots
I'll wear a shiny suit for a minute like I'm The LOX
Then get gangster with a swap meet bag and a Jordan box
And when I die, bury me with the glock and a bucket of shells
In case niggaz want drama in hell
Yeah, so when Compton niggaz and Fillmoe niggaz get together
Shit happens mayne, real talk from ya nigga Fig'
Doin' it big and don't wanna split yo' wig
I'll give you anything you ask fo', money over bitches
Tell me what'chu blast fo', fuck around with snitches
What you had to smash fo', niggaz tried to play me man
Anything you ask fo', all about this Bay game
Anything you ask fo', representin' Bay game
I'll give you anything you ask fo', money over bitches
Tell me what'chu blast fo', fuck around with snitches
What you had to smash fo', niggaz tried to play me man
Anything you ask fo', all about this Bay game
Anything you ask fo', representin' Bay game
I be the boy with the most cabbage, pluck strings like I'm Lenny Kravitz
I'm in the streets where they goin' savage
One, two, we dance on the rooftop
Let the Coupe ghost ride then we come to two stops
Figga eight'n by the corner sto'
Niggarali from killer Cali you gotta let 'em know
Yeahh, ya hit me on my Sidekick
Inventory pilin' up, niggaz tryin' to buy shit
They got me diggin in my files
Pro Tools, ADAT tapes and big sounds
Jumpin' on a plane, jumpin' out a taxi cab
Stackin' up this fettucini now these niggaz hella mad
Fuck that nigga, he got another album on the board?
Damn right, another album on the board
Fuck the bullshit, the Figgarali don't play

Anything you ask fo', all about this Bay game
Anything you ask fo', representin' Bay game
Count rubber band grands
I'm out big on the under, with my fam bam
And I, hover the lands
To expand, I'm from the gutter grime and the sand
No jams the flam's all busted
The dames want the bucks when, they see you stuffed in
Your pockets, 'til they get them some
But testin' my pocket, only gets you none
'Cause I, got a pimp mentality
The scrubs wanna eat shrimp and get my salary
They ain't knowin' I'm tight laced in my shoestrings
Hate the way I'm flowin' on the mic 'cause I do gleam
All types of baguettes and bezels
We shine like life's {unverified} rebels
2005, me and my crew just pile the pots
Move like the ice loose, pimp these thangs to watch

Intro:
Dre and Fidal
Niggas play everything live, nigga
Like Cool and The Game back in the day play it live, nigga
Fuck you niggas know about makin beats?
You dont know shit
Pussies (Ha ha)
Fuck you ever seen a nigga in his 20s with a guitar, bitch?
Verse 1:
Mothers only son, so I
Had to knock a nigga the fuck out on the block if he ever made my sisters cry
I was O Dog and Lorrenz taste dreams red everything niggas know what i mean
Red rag top and i made the dash pop
Before niggas came with stash spots, man
I was a dope man, dope man
I tried to tell em i could never be a felon, i was too good at sellin
Crack, X, Speed, and Heroin - fiends used to call me Monroe, cause i used to kill em down in Marilyn
Puttin niggas underground give me a shovel he still alive fuck him, i was on that level
Back then i aint believe in God, if he heal like they say on tv why bullets leave a scar?
Revenge is a feelin, but on my sons life when i catch the 2 niggas that shot me ima, kill em
Hook:
Desperate moments ive been waiting all my life
No mistakes i promise this will be my time
I know hustlin leads us to an early grave
But its the only way, how come niggas dying every day?
Verse 2:
I watched the coke price double up, i was too young to be a cook, so i had to sit back and watch it bubble up
Sittin in the window seein gang bangers knuckle up
Watchin the wind blow girls skirts while they double dutch
I had straight ds i wasnt in trouble much
Either you do my homework for me or ima fuck you up
Moms lied for me told her friends i was a nice student
Would a had all a's if algebra was Ice Cube
There it is, i studied a veteran hopin that one day i could be a fuckin hip hop legend
I listened to Nas, Big, Dre, Snoop and even though Pac hated him i bumped Jay too
Bought Reasonable Doubt and let it play straight through
Used to throw my head back, like Kanye do
Niggas never thought that i would break through, Irv, Gotti, and P Diddy passed but Jimmy and Dre knew
Hook
No clue on this part
Verse 3:
Im talkin to my niggas, All Stars and Timberlands
(North Face is a pin and its a million thugs marchin?)
For the dearly departed I elevated my knowledge
They say that i was name droppin, i was just payin homage
For Lil E and Tiana, im sayin that dear mama help me read between the lines pass periods and commas
The million dollar baby young homie tryna prosper
Act like you dont see me, you might win a Oscar
Act like you dont see me, I might just pop ya
Niggas singin like Sinatra i box like Bernard Hopkins
Left jab like Oscar, im the golden boy, you niggas seen what happened to Roy
Yeah, you niggas seen what happened to Roy
On my block niggas box we the knockout boys
Sittin in the throne with the Douja sparkin, its my seat and i aint movin like Rosa Parks
Ima be here
Hook
[The Game]
Second floor of my hotel
I'm rollin' up bout' to blaze
It's on now
To this Frankie Beverly and Mase
As our days about to pass
And our days in the past
He said my mind free
So my mind free at last
So much that I don't even drink from a glass
I'd rather find the first fountain I can
And do it fast
Didn't understand the dream of a king
I do the math
Coincidentally on ya birthdays
I ditched the Class
Cause the younger me, dumber me
Was chasin' the cash
Chasin' the ass
Lowlife with his face in the grass
Ridin' home from school
In front of the bus
Not even thinkin' bout how
Rosa Parks done it for us
How she stayed behind bars
And she done it for us
And she stayed behind bars
Till she won it for us
[Repeat: x2]
Sometimes I wanna give up
Or at least take a break
Thats when I close my eyes
And see Coretta Scott's face
[Nas]
Word up Game,
Standin at the Pu
Panoramic view of the seating
Greeting
I've been meanin
To do me some letter readin'
To the king, he forever breathin'
Your message is never leavin'
Some of your homies, fonies
I should said it when I seen em
Some sleezy bastards
Greedy pastors
Should never be allowed to be
In Ebenezer Baptist Church
In Atlanta
So people be patient
I know there's ghetto grammar
But I'm a street dude
Normally I just speak rude
Martin Luther
The model of truth
But hate killed em
Nobel peace prize winner
They duplicate the feelin'
As a kid, I ain't relate really
I sell your dream speak jokely
Till your world awoken me
First I thought you was passive
Soft one to ass kiss
I was young
But honest, I was feelin' Muhammad
I ain't even know the strip
You had to have the march
You were more than talk
The first real Bravehart
We miss you.
[The Game]
The word nigger
Is nothin' like nigga
Don't sound shit like
Like game like Jigga
One came before the other
Like aim and pull the trigga
Wanna slang for my brother
Wanna hang and take his picture
The rope ain't tight enough
He still alive, go fix it
Pour some gasoline on em
Call his daughters Black Bitches
Make em pick cotton
While his momma cleanin' up the kitchen
Same cotton in white tees
That's the cotton they was pickin'
If Dr. King marched today would Bill Gates march?
I know Obama would
But would Hillary take part?
Great minds think great thoughts
The pictures I paint
Make the Mona Lisa look like fake art
I feel the pain of Nelson Mandela
Because when it rains, it pours
I need Rhianna's umbrella
For Coretta Scott's tear drops
When she got the phone call that
The future just took a fuckin' head shot
I wonder why Jesse Jackson didn't catch em
Before his body drop
Would he give me the answer
Probably not
(hard liquor)
Dre you must've been of the hennessy when he did this my Nigga
(hard liquor)
(hard liquor)
(Is there anymore (hard liquor))
(make sure that it's mixed and twisted with a little bit of lemon juice on ice, on ice, on ice, Yeah)
(Verse 1)
You know me I turn them 40 bottles upside down
like niggaz with dead homies till it's empty like my 4 pound.
Niggaz thinkin I'm drunk
reach 4 my N.W.A chain and get ur ass beat wit da pump.
Tell security it's Game plus 50
and he probably gets fucked up every night like Bobby did Whitney.
Fuck poppin crystal
I got a bottle of henny
me and my nine stay together like Hardaway and lil'Penny
I ain't here so u can ask about Em or Dre
I came to see some bitches shake their ass like Beyonc.
So let me be hov' 4 a minute
get up in your hoe 4 a minute
and u could be my hoe 4 a minute.
Like I'm Diddy
be J-Lo 4 a minute
from the windows to the wall gettin low while I'm in it.
All I gotta do is hit em with a Jay-Z line
like u deserve to be my sunshine.
(chorus - J Love)
See her on the Floor
She's sexy
tell her where the af-
ter party is
but make sure that you see her friends before,
before, before, mmmmmmmmhhh
(Verse 2)
I'll spend a hundred dollars take a bitch to the hyatt,
then treat her like Busta like her ass on fire.
I'm a gangsta mah,
i wanna see you wiggle your butt cheeks both hands round your ankles mah.
all I wanna see is ass and titties.
shake it like they do in magic city
with T.I. in that mothafucka,
I'm like fifty [?PI?] in'this motha fucka.
You the them gold D's on that Porsche Truck
I show you how gangstas fuck
my 45 to the back of your weak
both of your arms in handcuffs
Take a bottle of Cisco to the head
see how you like getting fucked with a pistol to ya head.
tell ya girls I fucked your brains out,
we can do a manage-a-trois, pull the whips and chains out
I tear that frame out
I ain't no stunt man
I pull that range out
"BITCH"
(chorus - Jay Love)
See her on the Floor
She's sexy
tell her where the af-
ter party is
but make sure that you see her friends before,
before, before, mmmmmmmmhhh
(Verse 3)
I got 40's like the liquor store,
pour it on your weave like that bitch in the g-thang video.
You look wet, let me help you out your Von Dutch's
know you used to niggas spinning but tonight i'm fucking,
the truck stop, the rims spin, I know they hate me fuck em.
It's killa cally nigga haters come a dime a dozen
Load em shells then i get drunk pissy,
this bottle of Hennessy got me wanting to fuck Missy.
I'm a gangsta I can turn that bitch out,
play with her pussy then drop extasy in her crystal,
60 seconds later I'm kicking that bitch out.
then ride down the show with the 4-5th out
stop at the store
that bitch emptied my Cris out
give me 50 feet or I'll empty this clip out.
Niggas wanna know what this LA shit 'bout
just visit when the Bloods and Crips' out
(Is there anymore any more (hard liquor)
(make sure that it's mixed and twisted with a little bit of lemon juice
on ice, on ice, on ice, Yeah)
Punk ass motherfucker!
Bitch ass nigga!
What were you gonna do?
Kill me in my sleep you bitch ass nigga?
Tupac, Biggie shut the fuck up!
Fucking dogs, they barking shit
Don't shoot me! Don't shoot me!
Fuck you nigga!
And I'm grindin' until I'm tired
And you ain't grindin' until you tired
So I'm grinding with my eyes wide
Looking to find,
A way through the day
The life of the night
Dear lord you've take so many of my people
I'm just wondering why you haven't taken my life
Like what the hell am I doing right?
Take me away from the hood
Like a state penitentiary.
Take me away from the hood
In a casket or a Bentley.
Take me away
Like I overdosed on cocaine,
Or take me away
Like a bullet from Kurt Cobain.
Suicide.
I'm from a windy city
Like do or die.
From a block close to
Where Biggie was crucified.
That was Brooklyn's Jesus
Shot for no fucking reason.
And you wonder why Kanye
Wear his Jesus pieces.
(My life!)
Cause that's Jesus people,
And Game he's the equal.
Hated on so much
Passion Of The Christ need a sequel.
Yeah, like Rockefeller need a Segal.
Like I needed my father,
(My life!)
But he needed a needle.
I need some meditation
So I can lead my people.
They askin' why?
Why did John Lennon leave the Beetles?
And Why every hood nigga
Feed off evil?
Answer my question before this
Bullet leave this Desert Eagle.
And I'm grindin' until I'm tired
And you ain't grindin' until you tired
So I'm grinding with my eyes wide
Looking to find,
A way through the day
The life of the night
Dear lord you've take so many of my people
I'm just wondering why you haven't taken my life
Like what the hell am I doing right?
We are not the same,
I am a martian.
So approach my Phantom doors with caution.
You see them 24's spinnin'
I earned them.
And all the pictures of me an M I burned them
So it ain't no proof that I ever walked through 8 Mile
So they ain't no proof I ever walked through 8 mile
And since their ain't no proof I never walked through 8 mile.
Sometimes I think about my life with my face down.
Then I see my sons and put on that Kanye smile.
Damn I know his mama proud,
And since you helped me sell my dream,
We can share my mama now.
And like MJB, no more drama now.
Livin' the good life,
Me and Common on common ground.
I spit crack,
And niggas could drive it outta town.
Got a Chris Paul mind state,
I'm never out of bounds.
My life use to be empty
Like a Glock without a round.
Now my life full
Like a chopper with a thousand rounds.
And I'm grindin' until I'm tired
And you ain't grindin' until you tired
So I'm grinding with my eyes wide
Looking to find,
A way through the day
The life of the night
Dear lord you've take so many of my people
I'm just wondering why you haven't taken my life
Like what the hell am I doing right?
Walked through the gates of hell,
See my Impala parked in front,
With the high beams on.
Me and the devil
Sharing chronic blunts.
Listening to The Chronic album,
Playin' backwards.
Shootin' at pictures of Don Imus
For target practice.
My mind fucked up, so I
Cover it with a Raider hood.
I'm from the city that made you
Motherfuckers afraid of Suge
Made my Grandmother pray for good
And never made her happy,
But I bet that new Mercedes could.
Ain't no bars, but niggas can't
Escape the hood.
They took so many of my niggas,
That I should hate the hood.
But it's real niggas like me
That make the hood.
Ridin' slow in that Phantom
Just the way I should.
With the top back
And my Sox hat.
I'm Paid in Full,
The nigga Alvo couldn't stop that.
Even if they brought the nigga Pac back,
I'd still keep this motherfucker cocked back.
And I'm grindin' until I'm tired
And you ain't grindin' until you tired
So I'm grinding with my eyes wide
Looking to find,
A way through the day
The life of the night
Dear lord you've take so many of my people
I'm just wondering why you haven't taken my life
Like what the hell am I doing right?
My life
My life
My life
My life
We the best
I represent the hood
I represent the ghetto
I represent the people
I represent you
Listen!
All the money in the world couldn't change me
No diamond rings or them fancy cars
Cause my niggas in the hood woulda let me
Holler this because
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from the ghetto
(I'm from the projects) I'm from the projects
All over the world and every hood they know
I'm from the ghetto and that's fo' sho'
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from the ghetto
(I'm from the projects) I'm from the projects
All over the world and every hood they know
I'm from the ghetto and that's fo' sho'
Ayo Cali
Walk with me
Yeah that's what got me here
The chucks the khaki suits
All the swap meet years
The six dollar socks the five dollar rocks
Uncle Greg rest in peace he taught me how to chop
That's why I love the hood and everything we got
From the ice cream trucks to the forty ounce tops
All white Air Force Ones to fake Jacob watch
A few reasons why I drive the Bentley hard top
Use it in my songs cause I live it on the block
Tattoo it on my face let the whole world watch
I'm that type of nigga y'all made my city bigger dog
Turn the TV off got tired of watchin' Jigga boss
So we told our mom's we was lookin' for jobs
When we was really in the record store lookin' for Nas
Project of the ghetto, Ghetto and the project
From Compton to being Dre's number one prospect so
All the money in the world couldn't change me
No diamond rings or them fancy cars
Cause my niggas in the hood woulda let me
Holler this because
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from the ghetto
(I'm from the pojects) I'm from the projects
All over the world and every hood they know
I'm from the ghetto and that's fo sho'
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from the ghetto
(I'm from the projects) I'm from the projects
All over the world and every hood they know
I'm from the ghetto and that's fo sho'
Aha!
Yeah ugh
They know
Yeah ugh
Ain't no help there just food stamps
Weight checks and welfare
Every man gone for self there
Still might need to borrow your medicade card for health care
Yeah if you never got knocked then you made it
Everybody know each other if not they related
You can get shot or get bladed
There's dudes that got jobs now that had blocks in the eighties
Six months five years for you just to cop out
Ninth or tenth grade is usually when niggas drop out
Fights break out when you wired and start joking
A lot of OG's retired and started smokin'
House party games of spade sweet kool-aid
Loud music all night till the boys in blue raid
So therefore I could never be too paid
I know where I'm going and where I'm from will get you laid
All the money in the world couldn't change me
No diamond rings or them fancy cars
Cause my niggas in the hood woulda let me
Holler this because
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from the ghetto
(I'm from the projects) I'm from the projects
All over the world and every hood they know
I'm from the ghetto and that's fo sho'
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from the ghetto
(I'm from the projects) I'm from the projects
All over the world and every hood they know
I'm from the ghetto and that's fo sho'
Haha
Tell me this how come
Black folks get a little doe
And forget where they come from
Man we used to have good times
But since you moved on up you ain't cool with us
We still support you tho we don't see you much
You ain't the first fool its cool with us
But why you living out your idols dreams
Remember how for you came and help you keep those thangs
Now its cool that your address changed
But I'm tryna holla at my dog and the number ain't the same
I guess new homies came with his fame
But see true homies will stay the same
Through all the up's and down's in your career
A couple wives few kids scattered here
And when you dead or broke without a deal
All the groupies cleared
The ghetto will still be here
All the money in the world couldn't change me
No diamond rings or them fancy cars
Cause my niggas in the hood woulda let me
Holler this because
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from the ghetto
(I'm from the projects) I'm from the projects
All over the world and every hood they know
I'm from the ghetto and that's fo sho'
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from the ghetto
(I'm from the projects) I'm from the projects
All over the world and every hood they know
I'm from the ghetto and that's fo sho'
(We're too late)
Welcome to L.A.
MC's get fucked up, chopped like Braveheart
Don't start what you can't finish, serious bidness
Down La Seneca to bust a left on Venice
Where you can find me & mine, Los Angeles Times
Where every other day I'm taking the hat off my head (yeah)
Givin respect to the dead, & avoid havin the same thing
Said about me, Xzibit stand underground
Like the roots of a tree, watered three times a day
Forty ounce Olde E, like a magnifying glass
Making it easier to see, (yeah) the Mister X to the Z
Don't peak, L.A., why test without vest-es
Stop lead projectile, Apocalypse Now
Love Allah not new car, faggot, superstar
Type of cat, fuck that, mash away in a
Diamond-white Concourse 'Llac
Still black so the one-time react as if under attack
Ain't nothin changed but district range, feel no pain
Mr. Big Bad Insane Black John McClane with
Liquor on the brain, down to earth like dirt
From the city where niggaz known for puttin in work
Welcome to L.A.
Where you can see the whole city burning
'cause the cops got uzis & the dealers keep serving
& your kids ain't learning shit, except this
Sex power & wealth, so fuck everything else
Welcome to L.A.

'cause the cops got uzis & the dealers keep serving

Select turf, then plant bad seed & give birth
& make the hard work look easy fuh sheezee
Leavin you & your best man, stiffer than mannequins
Enough to break the skin on a Vietnam leatherneck
Marine drill sargeant, you nothin but a target (pow!)
Charge it to the game, gotta look beyond the brand name
Comin from the guts like I slammed down twenty cups
Of Hennesey straight, relate feel my hate
Xzibit flippin through these bitches like DJ trait
Translate to left field, only real niggaz follow
Bitches suck & swallow, I'm livin life behind the bottle
Never the role model, still shinin like a new automobile
Flow six-fo', you can't steal
Cause I got a kill switch with a itch for the action
While other rappers use mass weapons of distraction
To sell they shit
You can see the whole city burning
The cops got uzis & the dealers keep serving
& your kids ain't learning shit, except this
Sex power & wealth, fuck everything else
You can see the whole city burning
The cops got uzis & the dealers keep serving

[The Game]
See the bitches be wantin' a thug
And the ladies be wantin' a gentleman
If you don't wanna fuck wit a thug
I suggest you ride wit Ne-Yo
[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
This sex appeal
Can't be bought
It's not a skill
Can't be taught
This is a gentleman's affair if that's not you then please be off
This sex appeal
Can't be bought
It's not a skill
Can't be taught
This is a gentleman's affair if that's not you then please be off then please be off
[Verse One: The Game]
Fuck this old nigga whistlin' for?
Outside my door apartment 5B
While I learn to cook my first ounce of raw
Use to whistle while I work
She whistle while she twirk
Bitch bounce that ass while you roll that blunt it can't hurt
While you wet come out of that skirt
Bend over make it squirt
You can be my Superhead maybe we should try that first
Let me whistle while you jerk
Run my hand up ya shirt
If you wit it say you wit it let me hear my birdies chirp (we like it!)
Back shots make a bitch go berserk
The game will make it hurt
T-Pain know I'ma flirt (and we love it!)
Get ya ass up and fuck me then
I know you brought your girls
Girl fuck ya friends
Matter of fact I wanna fuck ya friends
Nah I ain't mean it like that, shit
[Chorus]
[Verse 2: Ne-Yo]
There's the door
Swags a standard
No less no more
If u have none
Let nezy know
Cause that's all they checkin' for
Flashin' paper
Player stop it
Swag is in you not in ya pocket
Try to buy
Ain't gone fly
Cause she want smooth
Gentleman life
She likes the way that everything
I do it so fresh and so clean
My tone is free no need to scream
Bounce like demeanor firmly
[Chorus]
[Verse 3: The Game]
Can't be about C-notes
She know my pockets deep enough to see a deep throat
But she won't see a dividend like 3 times ?
And that's triple X rated you know
My bitches only want the weed some X and some blow
Know not ask for the keys or no extra dough
I give em dick no dough
She give me shit she go
All she got was a baby and a Game logo
That was then this is now
Lift it up break it down
I go in she come out
That's when the pussy make the sound
It will never be the same
Every time when you fuck wit Game
Silk sheets long dick hot tub Lil Wayne
Like I ain't never ran from no pussy and I damn sure bout to pick a day to start runnin'
I said I ain't never ran from no pussy and I damn sure bout pick a day to start runnin'
[Chorus]
It all started back in '02//
I never thought Compton and Marcy would ever feud//
I aint talkin bout the big dude, big brotha to kanye
or da homeboy to the big dude//
The fiance to beyonce, had a protege
but wadn't no protage
that was as cold as Dre's//
Fuckin with me, mc's seen their coldest days//
He from compton, rap like he from new york in the golden age//
First nigga since ice cube from california to make Funk Flex blow granades//
I'm on the stage//
I hear the crowd callin my name//
They goin (Game Game)//
But i'm not one so dont try to play me//
This goes for every nigga from Gucci mane to Jay-z//
It's not a diss nigga dont catch feelins//
I'll pull out the pen d.o.c. gave me a kill it//
(Chorus)
If I could show you all the faces of the mc's that i ripped.... ah you would laugh you would laugh you would laugh
(Verse two)
As the clock strikes twelve on my rolly//
And this bitch from da Big Pimpin video starts to blow me (blow me)//
In the phantom,I start to fantasize//
This shit get thicker than bitches in Atlanta thighs//
It's suicide.. if you think you could fuck with the seven time platinum driver of that land rover truck//
And my ego bigger then the 26's, what if my pen had low pros//
I could ride them beats, like i ride backstreets//
After Snoop & Nas hang it up, its a track meat//
Nigga this race is fixed//
Game recognize Game,I aint never second place n shit//
My first 2 albums real basic shit//
Spend half the time in the studio erasing shit
A Queens nigga made me mad, So i made some hits
And learned one thing, hip hop can take some dick (aaaah)
(Chorus)
If i could show you all the faces of the mc's that i ripped.... ah you would laugh you would laugh you would laugh
(Verse three)
Half these rap niggas wiping they tears//
The other half wonderin how the fuck Game got here//
I took some weed up to frisco, came back with a demo
Drove to dre's studio came back in a limo//
It was that simple//
The crystal bottles and the bitches came later
And so did the haters//
As the doc turns the nob on fader//
And i turned the tv cause im tired of watchin the raiders//
Fast forward then Shaq gettin traded//
Then fast forward again the Shaq gettin traded//
And fuck all the time that was wasted//
Beefin with these wack niggas had me lost in the matrix//
If i wanted the crown I would just take it//
Put this 38. to yo dome bitch and just take it//
Im the music and its time to face it//
You niggas so fuckin pussy i can taste it//
(Chorus)
If i could show you all the faces of the mc's that i ripped.... ah you would laugh you would laugh you would laugh
If i could tell you all the things that i would do to kill yo.... favorite mc you would cry you would cry you would cry
[Raekwon]

[The Game (Raekwon)]
Money in zip duffle bags, shotgun shells

Owens, call it T.O., he leakin like a project sink
Busted open like a hot dog link

You goin' fuck around and get your head burnt
[Raekwon]
I'm a New York dinosaur, Staten Island artifact
Hip-Hop's never dead, the (Cuban) gave 'em heart attacks
Sleep in the woods, target cats come from under the V's
Sneeze wrong, course I'm clappin
Keep it movin homeboy, the mac's always actin
Spit in your face, go 'head lil' baby rappers
Can't fuck with us convicts, Stat-land
It's like actions, cliques'll die right with traction
It's Wall Street money and two gunny's
Slammers is extra chunky, yeah, me and my red monkeys
Silver back sales are few donkeys, all of us live comfy
Blow your head off like lunch meat
Chef in the game run the country
Take over the world little girl, better
Stay out our brunch meetin'
Fuck with they paper their gun squeezin'
Off top, leak from the cop, them nigga
Jumped, this is front season

[The Game (Raekwon)]
(Yo what if I was from Compton?) What if I was from Staten?

(Gorilla warfare) Shootouts, real block shit
West coast assassin on some real 2Pac shit
My style's smokin' like, after a glock spit
Game get the blood money, fuck bitches and pop Cris'
Style like it's New Year's, cause this a new year
Look at the tracks, either Bigfoot or
The Game been through here
The Benjamins won't stop, and neither would a chrome glock
I kill a fire-breathin' dragon with a dome shot
Come through your hood in a Chevy Malibu, on stocks
We had a meetin before we got here, and shit gon' pop
Heads gon' roll, Patron gon' spill
Fitted caps gettin' peeled like the chrome on the wheels
Got a half a mil', sing your wounds won't heal
I declare war, nigga who goin' deal?
[Raekwon]
Yeah, y'all know what time it is man
"Bulletproof Diary" nigga, for real
Many may read this man

Couple of mean Guatemalans with us
Half Guatemala, half Somalian nigga
Niggas ain't seen them colors man
Verse 1 - Techniec
------
In the rain with the beat, stashed with the heat,
smashed in the seat, sinking and thinking ya'll know the way I rhyme,
I'm a raw shined up, flossed out rhymed up,
get your wife good and ball it out till your time up.
Want to kill him quick?, put him in a filthy ditch,
rather be filthy rich, over a filthy bitch.
Wasn't for the flows,
wouldn't be no hoes jocking and breaking their necks to get your's,
so I suppose, rockin' show, knocking hoes,
flockin, I'm clocking dough, I control,
rock-n-roll, with soldiers on lock-n-load,
and they come through shoot it up,
fist fight, threw it up,
terrorize the future, truly number one who was us.
No question we'll bust glocks in fast cars,
blocks in Nascars, couple of bad brahs.
We got a few with us, none 50 trust,
you bitches hit the bus, you niggas ease up.
Chorus - The Game
------
I heard another nigga from that G-Unit click talking shit,
she's Tony Yayo,
and they kicked him out the house that's the reason why he running his lips,
he's on 50's payroll.
You want to die all you gotta do is keep on fucking with Game,
Mr. Yayo.
You niggas snitches that's the reason I threw out my G-Unit chain,
I ain't the po-po.
Verse 2 - Techniec
------
You rap guys better stick to rap,
cause colliding with hood niggas that spit it
will get you so call killas clapped.
And you'll think it's the fans,
but my niggas got the M 1 Sixes, get loose in the stands,
Techniec on the side of the stage with a gauge and 4 4 long deuce-deuce in his pants.
So I'ma just fall back, nigga I could lose you for a grand,
no gunpowder, residue in the hand.
They want to see Tech fly, they rather see Tech in the can,
I spit grams, till the check in the hand,
when the Tec in the hand, respect my demand,
or I'll find your set in a jam when the Tec will go blam!
Chorus - The Game
------
I heard another nigga from that G-Unit click talking shit,

and they kicked him out the house that's the reason why he running his lips,

Mr. Yayo.
You niggas snitches that's the reason I threw out my G-Unit chain,
I ain't the po-po.
Verse 3 - The Game
------
Drive-by, violator in the Bentley coupe,
ghost town outside, ain't nobody to shoot.
They call me Noman for all the heads I shot,
they call you state evidence for all the dime's y'all dropped.
Real love cause I'm a million dollar killa,
got banana clips for you so called gorillas.
G-Unit cap peeling till I D I E,
you looking for me, Southern Cali is where I be.
Chorus - The Game
------
I heard another nigga from that G-Unit click talking shit,

Watch your back because the next man is coming
And you don't know if the next man is dumbin
Survival of the fittest waht it is
I got yo back, you got my back and that's the biz
Blood is rushing through my veins
I got the power channel the energy
And with my strength I will devour
Sickening thoughts are running through my head
That's when I realize I'm glad I'm not dead
a second a glimpse of my father I see
And in a movement he beckons to me
And in a moment the memories are all that remain
And all the wounds are reopening again
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
And as you look all around at the world in dismay
What do you see, do you think we have learned
Not if you're taking a look at
It's in our nature to kill, kill, kill
It was a dream and then hit me, reality struck
And now my life is all shifty and it all moves fast
Clost to buck 50 and we all stand strong
In respect to the family in times of our insanity
And through the words of profanity
I describe our dysfunctional family
Blood Brothers keep it eally to the end
Deeper than the thoughts tha you think, not a trend
Put your lighters up if you want to
Pull your muthafuckin' Dodger caps
Over your muthafuckin' eyes til' you can't see shit
I want you to go blind, nigga
So you can feel how I felt
When I was in that muthafuckin' coma
Raised in the city of angels
Where safe and danger switch lanes
So stranger, drive slow
Where beggars and gangsta's pass
Women and dank are
Just part of a face that we show
We got mountains and ocean
We move in slow motion
Off that sticky you walk up to blow
I swear ain't nothin' better there
That's why we all take our hats off to you
The one Blood
Come to my hood, hood
Look at my block, block
That's that project buildin'
Yeah, that's where I got shot, shot
'Cause I was more hood than Suge
Had more rocks than Jay
More scars on my face than the original Scarface
Or the homeboy Scarface
Al Pacino couldn't be no gangsta'
Deniro on Casino, he no gangsta'
Wanna be, wanna see, wanna get a shovel
Dig tookie up nigga 'cause he know gangsta's
Niggas think 'cause they watch Menace a couple times
Seen Cube in Boys n The Hood and press rewind
That you can survive when a real Crip
Run upon your corner and flex the nine
You must be out of your mind
A real Blood will put you out of your mind
So stay the fuck up out of my hood
Or my niggas take you up out of your shine
It ain't a movie, dog
Hell yeah, it's a real fuckin' Uzi, dog
I'm 'bout to hop inside my Impala
Try to keep up, don't lose me y'all
Raised in the city of angels
Where safe and danger switch lanes
So stranger, drive slow
Where beggars and gangsta's pass
Women and dank are
Just part of a face that we show
We got mountains and ocean
We move in slow motion
Off that sticky you walk up to blow
I swear ain't nothin' better there
That's why we all take our hats off to you
The one Blood
I know the real O-Dog
And that nigga know the real Game
I call him the rinse tape
And he ain't never been in no gang
But he been in my house, house
And he set on my couch, couch
While I put one in the air
So yeah, that nigga know what I'm 'bout, 'bout
I'm 'bout my hood, I'm 'bout my block
I'm 'bout my chips so if the rat money stop
And I punch a clock
Catch you slippin' at a light, get out yo' shit
We jack niggas, out of towner's
And rap niggas, and ball players
'Cause we ball player
We chop it up with them trap niggas
We Outkasts, we big boys
Ludacris with them big toys
Where I'm from there's only
Two things standin' on the corner
Me and that liquor store
Look what the Bloods did to Weezy
Look what the Crips did to Jeezy
This gang banger shit ain't nothin' to play with
Me and Snoop Dogg just made it look easy
Raised in the city of angels
Where safe and danger switch lanes
So stranger, drive slow
Where beggars and gangsta's pass
Women and dank are
Just part of a face that we show
We got mountains and ocean
We move in slow motion
Off that sticky you walk up to blow
I swear ain't nothin' better there
That's why we all take our hats off to you
The one Blood
Y'all niggas got this LA shit real fucked up man
Niggas better start respectin' what the fuck we about man
We take niggas the fuck out
This shit ain't no movie, dawg
This shit is real, Crips, Bloods, Ese's
We hold shit down, this is LA
Wrote the shit on my face, put a muthafuckin' star behind
What the fuck I am, Starface
LA chronic, LAX files, case closed
Yeah, comin' fresh out that Pyrex pot,
Black Air Force 2's and the White Sox
Fitted on my forehead, try me, go head
I'll bring out the polka dots, put Game on your forehead.
Yeah, it's the new king of everything,
And bitches don't say no to me, I'm like a wedding ring.
Maybe it's how I pour that Patron,
Maybe it's how I smell a pair of Silver Cologne.
Maybe it's how I write shit when I'm in the zone,
And I'm sick of blow jobs, bitch leave me alone.
And tell Dr. Dre to pick up a phone,
Before I climb through his window like "Nigga I'm Home".
Runnin' the rock like OJ, nigga it's a throwback,
Fuck a Aston Martin, show me where the stove at.
Get a jar, some baking soda, nigga hold that,
The world is my grandma's kitchen, time to cook crack.
The Dope Boys in the building.

The same shit that Ludacris is on.
Disturbing the peace if my stash missing stones.
Yeah, count that work like a paycheck,
Niggas couldn't play The Game in a tape-deck.
A boss never touch work if it ain't taped yet.
That's how you get fucked, I practice safe sex,
And I take ya boy Curtis bitch with my tongue,
Lick lick lick like Shawna and have her sprung.
Show her my inner-condom and have her sprung,
And put it all in her stomach and just ugh!

So roll that coke white carpet to the hood.
It's the Dope Boys reunion, the dress code's strictly,
White tee, Air Force 1's and some Dickies.
I'm from the city where the skinny niggas die.
Only birds and Nextels chirp in the sky.
And we ride for the letters on our fitted cap,
Niggas hit the stash, get a strap, and go get it back!
That's for the gangstas, the hustlas, the ballas,
From Downtown LA to Uptown Harlem.
And D-Boy money ain't rain and it's stormin'.
So stop the music when the Champagne pouring.
And hold the glasses high,
And when a nigga ask you why, you tell 'em
The Dope Boys in the building.
What's up? The Dope Boys. What's up? The Dope Boys.

Haha, yeah
The King is back!
Now is the time
To follow the wind
To walk alone
And a star will show the way
Above the clouds
Beyond the sea
And now is the time
And now and farewell
And as we part
You taught me well
You gave me strength
You showed the way
I'll not forget you
Like an eagle I will soar above the clouds
I will spread my wings and fly into the sun
Like an eagle I will race above the stars
I will fly to places yet unseen
Go beyond my wildest dream

You taught me well
You gave me strength
You showed the way

Like an eagle I will soar above the clouds
I will spread my wings and fly into the sun
Like an eagle I will race above the stars
I will fly to places yet unseen
Go beyond my wildest dreams
Know that you are watching over me
Alone, I can fly with the eagle to the mountain high
Race with the eagle To the rising sun
and soar with the eagle, so far beyond my dreams
like an eagle I will fly.....
Like an eagle soar above the clouds
I will spread my wings and fly into the sun
Like an eagle I will race above the stars
I will fly to places yet unseen
Go beyond my wildest dreams

Like an eagle I will fly
Like an eagle I will fly....

Look what the bloods did to Weezy
Look what the crips did to Jeezy
This gangbanger shit ain't nothing to play with
Me and Snoop Dogg just made it look easy
[Chorus]
You niggas got this L.A shit real fucked up man
Niggas better start respecting what the fuck we about man
We take niggas the fuck out, this shit ain't no movie dawg
This shit is real crips, bloods, ese
We hold shit down, This is L.A.
Wrote the shit on my face, put a motherfucking star behind
What the fuck I am, starface!
Punk ass motherfucker!
Bitch ass nigga!
What were you gonna do?
Kill me in my sleep you bitch ass nigga?
Tupac, Biggie shut the fuck up!
Fucking dogs, they barking shit
Don't shoot me! Don't shoot me!
Fuck you nigga!
And I'm grindin' until I'm tired
And you ain't grindin' until you tired
So I'm grinding with my eyes wide
Looking to find,
A way through the day
The life of the night
Dear lord you've take so many of my people
I'm just wondering why you haven't taken my life
Like what the hell am I doing right?
Take me away from the hood
Like a state penitentiary.
Take me away from the hood
In a casket or a Bentley.
Take me away
Like I overdosed on cocaine,
Or take me away
Like a bullet from Kurt Cobain.
Suicide.
I'm from a windy city
Like do or die.
From a block close to
Where Biggie was crucified.
That was Brooklyn's Jesus
Shot for no fucking reason.
And you wonder why Kanye
Wear his Jesus pieces.
(My life!)
Cause that's Jesus people,
And Game he's the equal.
Hated on so much
Passion Of The Christ need a sequel.
Yeah, like Rockefeller need a Segal.
Like I needed my father,
(My life!)
But he needed a needle.
I need some meditation
So I can lead my people.
They askin' why?
Why did John Lennon leave the Beetles?
And Why every hood nigga
Feed off evil?
Answer my question before this
Bullet leave this Desert Eagle.
And I'm grindin' until I'm tired
And you ain't grindin' until you tired
So I'm grinding with my eyes wide
Looking to find,
A way through the day
The life of the night
Dear lord you've take so many of my people
I'm just wondering why you haven't taken my life
Like what the hell am I doing right?
We are not the same,
I am a martian.
So approach my Phantom doors with caution.
You see them 24's spinnin'
I earned them.
And all the pictures of me an M I burned them
So it ain't no proof that I ever walked through 8 Mile
So they ain't no proof I ever walked through 8 mile
And since their ain't no proof I never walked through 8 mile.
Sometimes I think about my life with my face down.
Then I see my sons and put on that Kanye smile.
Damn I know his mama proud,
And since you helped me sell my dream,
We can share my mama now.
And like MJB, no more drama now.
Livin' the good life,
Me and Common on common ground.
I spit crack,
And niggas could drive it outta town.
Got a Chris Paul mind state,
I'm never out of bounds.
My life use to be empty
Like a Glock without a round.
Now my life full
Like a chopper with a thousand rounds.
And I'm grindin' until I'm tired
And you ain't grindin' until you tired
So I'm grinding with my eyes wide
Looking to find,
A way through the day
The life of the night
Dear lord you've take so many of my people
I'm just wondering why you haven't taken my life
Like what the hell am I doing right?
Walked through the gates of hell,
See my Impala parked in front,
With the high beams on.
Me and the devil
Sharing chronic blunts.
Listening to The Chronic album,
Playin' backwards.
Shootin' at pictures of Don Imus
For target practice.
My mind fucked up, so I
Cover it with a Raider hood.
I'm from the city that made you
Motherfuckers afraid of Suge
Made my Grandmother pray for good
And never made her happy,
But I bet that new Mercedes could.
Ain't no bars, but niggas can't
Escape the hood.
They took so many of my niggas,
That I should hate the hood.
But it's real niggas like me
That make the hood.
Ridin' slow in that Phantom
Just the way I should.
With the top back
And my Sox hat.
I'm Paid in Full,
The nigga Alvo couldn't stop that.
Even if they brought the nigga Pac back,
I'd still keep this motherfucker cocked back.
And I'm grindin' until I'm tired
And you ain't grindin' until you tired
So I'm grinding with my eyes wide
Looking to find,
A way through the day
The life of the night
Dear lord you've take so many of my people
I'm just wondering why you haven't taken my life
Like what the hell am I doing right?
My life
My life
My life
My life
Cool and Dre
Back on the motherfuckin' Westside
L.A.X niggas, yeah
Y'all know who the fuck I am
I'm free as a motherfuckin' bird, I swear
Disappear in thin air, there go Game, nigga where?
Posted on the block in them black Airs
In that all black Phantom, hug the block like a bear
Yeah, that V12 is roarin'
Flyin' through the city with the pedal to the floor then
I put them 26 inches on the curb, tell the hood I'm back
Give me a corner, let me serve
Swerve, I'm still dope that's my word
All I did was the switch the kitchens, did some tracks on the birds
Irv, Gotti know I'ma murderer
Half these niggas beefin' with me, I never heard of them
If I was the old me I would murder them
Matter fact, if I was the old me, I would Curtis them
Courtesy of my Smith & Wesson
I kill tracks like aids, nigga get infected
The whole world been waitin' on him
Here I come, droptop Phantom

Big cars, big wheels, big chain
Big pimpin', big money
Big dreams, dreams, dreams
Big dreams, dreams, dreams
Big dreams, dreams
I get money like Junior Mafia used to
On my way to school ten thousand in my FUBU
Lunchtime, I was sellin' behind the bungalows
Baggin' up rocks the size of melons
That's when the fiends start tellin'
You can catch 'em on the couch everyday at 4 o'clock like Ellen
Prime-time, nigga, it's my time, nigga
Jacob ain't got shit to do with my shine, nigga
?Cause when the sun come up from behind the sea
Niggas see me behind the be
E N T, don't stand for entertainment
Stands for 0 to 60, anybody see where Game went?
To the hood, parked crooked behind that chained fence
And I'm going down behind my dogs, but I ain't Vick
Tell me one album I put out that ain't sick?
No, I'm not the Doctor but I produce the same shit
The whole world been waitin' on him
Here I come, droptop Phantom
I'm skatin' on 'em, look around
All the bitch niggas hatin' on him
Mad ?cause I'm Chronic 2008tin' on them
Big cars, big wheels, big chains

The lion's in the room, waddup Fat Joe?
I'm Curtis' kryptonite and the nigga Joey Crack know
Whoever said, ?The Game over?, musta had a hangover
Get money, my driveway sponsored by Range Rover
I got blood diamonds straight outta Angola
Wave my red rag in the air, signal Lil' Wayne over
Yeah, that's when the Crys start poppin'
The pills start droppin' and the haters start watchin'
The DJ starts spinnin', the panties get the droppin'
For album number three, it goin' platinum's not an option
I'm back with Cool and Dre a.k.a. the monsters
And I got one word for you motherfuckers, Compton
The whole world been waitin' on him
Here I come, droptop Phantom

"Ain't Fuckin With You"
[Intro]
That T.M. shit, that T.M. shit
Trackmasters, that T.M. shit, that shit
That T.M. shit Game!
[Chorus: unknown singer (The Game)]
I don't care that you lookin like Beyonce on her best day
(I ain't fuckin wit'chu)
You got your high heels on and your body feel warm but tonight
(I ain't fuckin wit'chu)
You got your hair did right and your panties too tight but tonight
(I ain't fuckin wit'chu)
Could be another night, girl, but tonight
(I ain't fuckin wit'chu)
[The Game]
I'm tired of playin your games, you pissin me off
I'm watchin LeBron so holla when this shit go off
You say I be trippin but really it's you that be gone
Always bringin up Tanisha be givin me dome
I ain't tryin to hear that, I'm just tryin to chill
So chill, like Chamillionaire or Mike Jones grill
All in front of my flat screen, True Religion black jeans
Dancin like Ciara, I ain't Bow Wow or 50
Tryin to get me but I back out, I could blow your back out
Lay you down, put it in the hole, like Stackhouse
We used to hit midtown, throwin all them stacks out
Run through the Louis Vuitton store and clean the racks out
Used to feel good, when I watch your Porsche back out
You bought Keyshia Cole album, now you tryin to act out
Flippin like a Sidekick, tell me what is that 'bout?
You can't take the heat, get the fuck up out of Shaq house
Black out
[Chorus]
[The Game]
Bitch, I'm rollin 21's and over
Not the club, the dubs on that platinum Range Rover
My neck's so iced out, my wrists so shined up
I make hoes line up, see a pole climb up
Brown sugar or light skin, black or white skin
If she could drop it low then she could be my night friend
Or my one night stand, if she got a nice tan
Before I leave I cut the light off of your nightstand
Back to the house, my girl wanna have real sex
Nah, I keep my kids like Britney Spears' ex
Take her back to the future, I ain't even here yet
And that line was fly, bitch I'm a Leer jet
[Chorus]
[The Game]
Stop playin girl, stop playin
Stop playin girl, stop playin!
Stop playin girl, stop playin
I said stop playin, you better stop playin
'Fore I break you off like a Kit Kat, you know I wanna hit that
Banana split that, but a real nigga had to sit back
Cause that's what we do, when girls be with the chit-chat
Every mornin on "The View", them girls be with the chit-chat
Enough with all the riff-raff, let me see your cat walk
I'm old school, Garfield, I can make your cat talk
But I'm a gangsta, so I'ma back off
Keyshia and DMX, I'll leave yo' ass with that thought
For real
[Chorus]
[Outro]
That T.M. shit, uh-huh, that T.M. shit
Trackmasters, that T.M. shit, that shit
That T.M. shit Game!
[Ne-Yo]
Oh, hey!
[Game]
Picture me and my gangsta girl,
Riding with the top back.
Banging Ne-Yo, my neck free yo,
My SOX hat,
Tilted to the side
Like you know I get my grind on.
Get my shine on.
Jewelry Black in all rhinestones.
Rims spinning like a globe,
On these low pros.
Do it big cause I'm supposed to floss,
And that's the reason she break me off.
Cause I'm gangsta,
And I'm riding with
[Ne-Yo]
Ne-Yo, it's a thug and a gentleman.
Rollin like a boss through,
No matter the cost too,
Kept trying to brag, what?
Money not a issue.
Don't let your girl see us.
That might make her diss you.
Cause if she roll wit us,
She wont even miss you.
[Game]
Pop rubber bands when I throw a stack,
Before it hit the ground she throw it back.
When I make it rain that's chump change,
That pay for the 26
On my range range range drive drive,
Take the wheel while I roll and slide,
Climb over to the passenger side and freeze.
[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
And once again it's on,
You should take a picture
With your camera phone.
Player she not coming home,
And if I'm on her screen saver,
That, that mean later we gone.
If I let her take a picture,
She gonna roll wit me.
If I let her take a picture,
She gonna roll wit me.
If I let her take a picture
She gonna roll wit me,
Gonna roll wit me,
Gonna roll wit me.
[Game]
If you don't know by now baby I'm a star,
Look at my face,
Look at my car,
Look at my waist then look at my scars.
Look out da window see where we are.
In my phantom, in my rover, banging
[Ne-Yo]
Ne-Yo, it's a thug and a gentleman.
She ain't never rolled in a car with the suicide,
Girl when it's you and I, they committing suicide.
All of them want, my girl.
Cause she pretty and thick in the thighs.
Homie don't mastermind,
Do a song wit suicide.
[Game]
She call me Jay, I call her B,
We getting married, to the streets.
I'm chasing money, she chasing me.
I'm right where I wanna be,
With the B on my Bentley,
The horse on my Lambo,
Crown on my Cadillac,
Checks on my air max.
Haters, better fall back,
Before I put something in your ball cap.
That's my chick,
I got her back like a bra strap.
Cause she fine and she cute,
She think she all that, and she all that.
That's my girl that's my world,
[Chorus]
Game can you take a picture?
Ne-Yo can you t 75e take a picture?
We've been waiting all night,
Just to take a picture wit you.
Game can you take a picture?
Ne-Yo can you take a picture?
We've been waiting all night,
Just to take a picture wit you.
[Game]
Grab the wheel take control,
And let your hair blow inside my Lambo.
Pull out ya phone, picture that.
Take it home let ya man know I'm hitting that.
While I'm hitting that,
She send it back,
She drop it low,
We about to blow.
Me and N-E-dash-Y-O yo girl know.
She so Ciara,
So eve,
So Mariah,
So Be,
She so Trina,
I'm R. Kelly,
She remind me of my goldies.
I'm cooly high, I'm cochi,
She a 34 D, I'm so pleased.
I'm so so def, she so Janet,
I'm JD and she full of me.
In the H2 we fold
Deep through the NYC off no sleep.
I hate to drive but I break it wide,
When I'm riding with my shorty.
I'd kidnap her and never take her home,
Riding off banging Ne-yo sitting on chrome,
In that Maserati, see the paparazzi,
They... She gone.
[Chorus]
Dodge This
Catch me if you can I'm in those old school Barkley's,
Back to the fence, puffin' on that Bob Marley,
Flow like a regeno, nigga you already know,
My competition stiffer than Ronald Regan, let it go
For you be a mother-fuckin' vegetable,
You scrap niggas too animated like the Incredibles,
Let this beef go around like the 26th,
Its young Game of Flame, welcome to the House of Pain
Nigga what about the game?
Keep on playin' boy, I'll hop of this fuckin' Range,
Look, I ain't even ask for his fuckin' chain,
But he took it off like Vanessa-Del-Rio,
Now I'm on my way to "Reo"
After I see I my PO
She cool, she a Leo
She ain't trippin' off the weed smoke
So I'ma blow it like the Patriots
And throw my dove up, cause Dr.Dre made me Rich
[Chorus]
Where you from? California
What city? Compton
What you drive? Impala
What you smokin' on? Chronic
What you drinkin' on? Patron
What you sittin' on? The Trone
Relax, make yourself at home
Welcome to Compton
Welcome to Compton
Welcome to Compton
Welcome to Compton
I wrote the block off, I talk that shit,
Size 12 Bo Jacksons cause I walk that shit,
There on Compton Blvd, thats where I walk my pits,
Biggie and Tupac, and they bark like this
As I spark my splif,
I see the corner, puttin' chalk around the snitch,
We be shootin' like free throws, flying them desert Eagles,
Sell dope to the pope, while we eatin' chilli freetos
From a gang-banger, to a CEO,
Everything I do is big like the nigga Ceaser-leo,
Wont stop till I'm dead,
Ain't gotta watch for the feds,
They ain't watchin' me so here's a dome shot to the head
As I take a Patron shot to the head,
And reminisce about the shit the DOC said,
"Get money, Get cars, get mine, get yours,
And keep your head up, like the Lambo doors"
[Chorus]
Guess its time to break the number nine Jordan's in,
Make a nigga made, when they been tryna floor the Benz,
I'm doin' one sixty in the fast lane,
Scott Storch, in his Bogadi, couldn't pass game,
I got it made like my last name,
I'm gone, just like my After-math Chain
Don't make me take you back to '96,
Leanin' on that dostin', on the corner, eatin' catfish,
The Game, Da-Da-Da-Game, spit that shit,
I'm controversial, like the Afro-pic with the Black fist,
Just ask the rapper that had to catch my last diss,
I'm reckless, and I ain't never crash whips,
My pops wasn't around, so this bastard,
Bleed California from the cradle to the Casket,
And I wont stop ridin' for my coast,
Niggas keep talkin' bout my bread, we gonna make toast
[Chorus]
[Hook - Swizz Beats]

A horse on my lambo, crown on Cadillac,
chatz on my air matz, beef haters beta fall back,

Bounce with me n be my fantasy, a magic love so bright its got me ....

I don't see nothing, I hear you talking about it
Pull up with Stunna leaning in that Bugatti
No we ain't trippin', I know you ain't about it
But I got my nina, don't leave the crib without it
I don't see nothing, I hear you talking about it (murder, murder)
Pull up with Stunna leaning in that Bugatti (murder, murder)
No we ain't trippin', I know you ain't about it (murder, murder)
But I got my nina, don't leave the crib without it (murder, murder)
Murder, murder
Murder, murder
Murder, murder
Murder, murder
I got choppers all down South Beach
That pistol talk when your mouth leak
Got a black Impala on Collins, nigga
Got a Glock in air, standing in the back seat, I'm wildin', nigga
Long money, fuck a rubber band
On a paper chase, I do the running man
Stealth black chopper with the infrared beam on
Fifty round drum, if I run out of bullets, hit a nigga with the nina
Better hit a nigga with the scope
Bet he won't talk with his back on the rope
Floyd Mayweather with the chopper
When a nigga get to choppin' put a razor blade at a nigga throat
I don't fuck with no scared niggas
I never did and I never will
Let the Glock go bang, now you Kurt Cobain
Knock a nigga right out of real
I don't see nothing, I hear you talking about it
Pull up with Stunna leaning in that Bugatti
No we ain't trippin', I know you ain't about it
But I got my nina, don't leave the crib without it
I don't see nothing, I hear you talking about it (murder, murder)
Pull up with Stunna leaning in that Bugatti(murder, murder)
No we ain't trippin', I know you ain't about it (murder, murder)
But I got my nina, don't leave the crib without it (murder, murder)
You shinin', we shinin'
You timin', we timin'
You grindin', we grindin'
We got cash money and diamonds
You shinin', we shinin'
You timin', we timin'
You grindin', we grindin'
We got cash money and diamonds
Take a nigga back to Compton and chop a nigga body up
Take a trip to East LA and chop a new Maserati up
Take my black Bugatti, do donuts on Greenleaf
Then hit Crenshaw doin' 300, nigga Chief Keef
Ridin' down Crenshaw, stuntin' with my bitch though, ballin'
I'm from Compton, she from Watts, but we both got pistols
Blowin' trees with the top down, word to YG
If you don't want a problem motherfucker, why speak?
Niggas killed my nigga Pup, tell them niggas try me
Keep two K's in the back, shotty in the front and the chrome side beach
No disrespect to the Dogg or the city Long Beach
But I'm the king out here, motherfucker on me
[Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
See, ever since the day I got the chance to make a change
I've been in this game, it's a new day
And I'm making it known cause I just want the world to know
I'm paying my dues, and I got the utmost, I just wanna let you know
I'm payin' homage 'cause you've paved the way for me, yeah
[Verse 1: The Game]
I swear to God, it feel like every day is my birthday
Let the top down, California's my birthplace
So I'ma take you there like B.I.G took niggas to New York
"Juicy" had us feeling like we was from New York
And that's real shit blazed the Philly
It's summertime shout out to Will Smith
Cause who didn't wanna be the Fresh Prince
Flat top, gold chain and some fresh kicks?
My nigga Nas told me money make the world go round
And Uncle Luke showed me how to make my girl go down
I've been around Hip Hop since '85
She had her ups and downs but she stayed alive
I used to think LL stood for Love LA
He from Queens, how the fuck he put that with Cool J?
Red Kangol hat, red sweatsuit to match
Red Adidas, nigga, Game is back
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
Public Enemy and N.W.A is on my boom box, had to say
Today was a good day, had the hood buzzin'
Ice Cube my favorite rapper, y'all niggas can't tell me nothin'
Everybody's first bootleg was Boyz 'n the Hood
Whoever thought gangsta rap would make noise in the hood
When the cars ride by with the boomin' system
Two door Mustang and the roof was missing
Every girl at ya school had the new extensions
Even gangstas was dancin' like New Edition
Cause the house parties stayed rockin' all night
Niggas came through and shot it up but it was alright
Cause after the cops left, it was a party then
You down with OPP, then bring Naughty in
They say it never rain in southern California, Tony Toni lied
Sit back, watch Game throw his money in the sky
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M get the money
In the back, I relax with all the honey's
DJ bring it back, let it go
Mix it in with Black Rob, make 'em say whoa!
Every thing full circle, Game livin' major
Girls on my hip like a Skytel pager
Now I'm on the top, let the champagne pop
Throw ya hands in the sky 'cause The Game don't stop
Just a little more change, gotta Benz and the Range
Every rap metaphor always ends in my name,
The Kool Hercs, DJ Red Alerts
Before I was born they was talking 'bout The Game
Ask a Jay-Z fan 'bout Big Daddy Kane
Don't know him, Game gonna show 'em
Just like they showed me, my lyrics is O.G
When it's all said and done, you niggas gon' quote me
[Chorus]
[Keyshia Cole]
See, Mary J. I want you to understand you paved the way (for me)
I'm givin' homage (to you)
I spent my day so, first I pray yo
Then I lay low, looking for the halo
Or more yayo, my little angel
Reminded me to stay playful
Faithful walks I take in the woods
Thinking whats good, things that I can change I should
Things I can't, need to be understood
Th-this is the bliss, I used to drift from the hood
For a second at least, I'm resurrecting the peace
Pipes that Indians used to light, we called it Chief, right?
Stepping on the leafs right, to reach heights
Th-th-th-that I never seen, it's so so evergreen
Some use it for medicine, or to write better things
I was in Amsterdam man, bike pedalling
To the nature spot to taste the flavours they got
My eyes drop, I like it a lot
Yeah, my angel
I wanna turn up the sound and spread
my wings because I'm riding with my (Angel)
Going through the city of the Chi
make me feel like I'm in the city of (Angels)
Oooh I wanna fly, fly away with my (Angel)
She takes me high, she will always be my (Angel)
Th-th-the way that I rhyme, blow nigga's mind
Like the first time you heard Mary J and you were standing in line
To purchase tickets to see her blow like Chicago wind
And I'm ridin with Common looking for Chicago Zen
And like Chicago winds, I was once a Street Disciple
Rockin every Jordan shoe, Nike put out by Michael
That made me feel like I could fly, sometimes I wanted to die
Prolly cause the angel dust was fuckin with my third eye
So I start hip-hop and I understand why Common used to love her
She got me open so I even had to fuck her
But I used the rubber, cause she was married to Rakim
So I bought me a gold chain, pretendin' that I was him
So I can get close to the girl I loved the most
But she left Cali and went on tour with Ne-Yo and Ghost
Big gave her one more chance, and she took Big down
I should've knew it, Shock G and Pac told me "She get around", an angel
I wanna turn up the sound and spread
my wings because I'm riding with my (Angel)
Going through the city of the Chi
make me feel like I'm in the city of (Angels)
Oooh I wanna fly, fly away with my (Angel)
She takes me high, she will always be my (Angel)
Fly away, fly away
My love for her is not about jewelry and cars
I love her cause she love me, just for who I are
Who I is, who I am, resembles the rims on the Lam'
I shine like Shyne when Barrington Levy was sayin, "Didilly whoooa!"
I got love for the streets, peace to New York and every hood in the East
Before I was duckin' cops, gunshots
I used to be an L.A. Dodger, now I'm a (Angel)
From the city of lost souls, Impalas and polished gold
Between the car, and the rims, we got a lot of chrome
Your hood not alone, they knockin, we not at home
And when they bust in, we not Caesar, but gotta roam
Cause they try to wire phones, I'm talking Verizon phones
The ones they put wires on, they got us on tap
But I put wires on, my Bentley in fact
I spit it through the wires on a Kanye track
I wanna turn up the sound and spread
my wings because I'm riding with my (Angel)
Going through the city of the Chi
make me feel like I'm in the city of (Angels)
Oooh I wanna fly, fly away with my (Angel)
She takes me high, she will always be my (Angel)
Yeah, it's The Game and Common
Spread your wings, follow your dreams
Things will be so serene, L.A. and the Chi is a team
Yeah, angel supreme
Yeah, keep on
Yeah, it's for the world boy, we do it forever, yeah
Money, for the money [Repeat: x2]
[Verse 1]
Kanye told me that Jesus walks in '04
But I grew up around impalas and drug lords
Welcome to Los Angeles palm trees and drug stores
All we know is rocks and presidents like Mount Rushmore
Fuck the police they hop out and bust doors
I ain't goin' back to jail nigga that what I flush for
My money or my glock who do I trust more?
I don't know it's probably the one that I touch more
Guess it's the green cause paper motivate niggas
And my Rolex races cause it hate niggas
I use to only sell 8s like that Laker nigga
Now I'm movin' 24s like I play at the staples center
You might miss the game so nigga don't blink
My phantom stand out like Frank Lucas mink
So go ahead and think like Frank Lucas think
Somebody'll find your brains on the fuckin' kitchen sink about
[Chorus]
(Money)
Dead presidents, Big paper
(For the Money)
Benjamins, Skyscrapers, My niggas get
(Money)
My Bitches get
(Money)
Like the strippers get
From the block to the club I make it rain
(Money)
In California niggas die
(For the Money)
From the south to new york the bullets fly for the
(Money)
Don't stop gettin'
(Money)
It don't matter where you from if you hustle motherfucker keep gettin' that
(Money)
[Verse 2]
Yeah Yeah
I get it that baby and slim cash money
All the jewelry on your whole crew that's my tax money
That Pablo Escobar crack money
That Lebron first nike contract money
That make it rain all my niggas throw a stack money
Stack it to the ceiling then call it Shaq money
That walk in the club, straight to the back money
Flavor of love delicious sittin' on my lap money
That rat money niggas get clapped money
Air force ones don't bend when I track money
Oh I'm rich like porter,
Havin' Alpo nightmares whippin' that border
Like McDonald's I was flippin' them orders
In that '02 Porsche truck weavin' through borders
I was through flippin' quarters When I made my first mil
I'm about a dollar 50 cent ain't real
[Chorus]
[Verse 3:]
Ooh Somebody tell snoop to pop open them briefcases
Order that patron tell em we want 3 cases
Fuck a black card you see these green faces
Look at my chest, now you've seen Vegas
Treat my money like the Crystal that we wastin'
Cause I'm a money machine I can re-make it
You a fool thinkin' that Freddy can see Jason
I been iced out like who the fuck need Jacob
The doc told me to be patient but I walked
Money like the white Howard next time he a free agent
I'm tryin' to make enough money so I can feed Asia
Have Asians in the kitchen cookin' in Louis V aprons
Word to Martha Stewart if I can park a Buick
Then I can flip a breech truck I got the heart to do it
Ball like the nigga Tony Parker do it
Speak no englis but Dinero I talk it fluent
[Chorus]
Get get get get g-get your paper boy [Repeat: x3]
Get get get get get get yea!
Let me tell you a story about this bitch I know
Grew up on the south side sucking dicks for dough
Give her a half a dollar, she'll put on a show
Do anything to be in a Dr. Dre video
The bitch went Hollywood, one trip to the west coast
She got fucked by this white bitch, had her legs wide open
As long as my pockets were fat
I didn't give a fuck where the bitch was at
My pretty young bitch keep my nuts drained
But all the time she was plotting on my aftermath chain
Bitch couldn't stay in here lane
Started running with this hoe from the south
Gold grill in her mouth, she put her on the track
Gave her, her first thong introduced her
To her two girlfriends from back home
Fucked the industry, tryna take the fast route
Ran into a gangster and he turned they ass out
You gon' always be my bitch, my bitch, my bitch
And I'm a always love my bitch, my bitch, my bitch, my bitch
I can always fuck my bitch, my bitch, my bitch
And she gon' always be my bitch, my bitch, my bitch, my bitch
From the projects hustled all day
Niggas called her Sophie from around the way
Used to play hard to get, so they thought she was gay
Booshie bitch who ever thought she was raised in BK
Moved out the hood, changed her name to Jay
Told everybody she'll be working with a mill one day
I was introduced to her back in '96
She had a wavy haircut and some big ass lips
At first she was hard to hit, come to find out
The last 10 years she been sucking Big dick
Got a family now, a house made of bricks
Four grown ass kids and ain't none of them shit
She still my bitch so I stayed around
But she always tryna dash when other dame's around
She tryna play The Game, but I got the bitch number
She said she won't, but she'll be back next summer
You gon' always be my bitch, my bitch, my bitch
And I'm a always love my bitch, my bitch, my bitch, my bitch
I can always fuck my bitch, my bitch, my bitch
And she gon' always be my bitch, my bitch, my bitch, my bitch
Last but not least my gangsta bitch
From Compton always in and out of jail and shit
Bitch tried to burn Snoop, stole chronic from doc
Blew the whole west coast, even tried to fuck Pac
Type of bitch to stand on Beverley Hills
Word on the street's she got a few real niggas killed
I look up now she on my dick
Telling me how she always gonna be my bitch
Pop up at award shows always following me
Bitch doing dumb shit, got a college degree
No pre-nupt, one nigga got stick with her
I was smart knew always not to fuck with her
What goes around comes around
Scandalous shit, somebody tried to kill that bitch
Burnt the bridges and ain't had one friend left
Niggas that know her called her the devil in that red dress
You gon' always be my bitch, my bitch, my bitch
And I'm a always love my bitch, my bitch, my bitch, my bitch
I can always fuck my bitch, my bitch, my bitch
And she gon' always be my bitch, my bitch, my bitch, my bitch
[Chorus]
California sunshine, in the summer time
California sunshine, in the summer time
California sunshine, in the summer time
California sunshine, in the summer time
Last year, Jazze Phe got stuck up inside the grand Lux,
Most recent was 50 in Angola, that's what's up,
Any rapper could touched, any bitch could get fucked,
Under the California sun, impalas and big trucks,
They say Suge got knocked out, but don't play that nigga cheap,
Cause you're body might wash up by the courts at Venice Beach,
Ain't shit sweet but my Swisher, ain't shit buzzin' but my liquor,
Cali chickens got to the 80's strip and come back a little thicker,
With more ass then Delicious, that's my flavor of love,
We make it rain like Rain-man, when he play with the glove,
I'm the king to you pawn niggas, punisher, spawn, niggas,
Playin' in green, Paul Pierce to you Lebron niggas,
We them barbecue, front and back lawn niggas,
Summer Jam, throw your ass offstage Akon niggas,
We drink Kool-Aid with the ice on your arm nigga,
Take that Champion hoody off in the California sunshine
[Chorus]
I'm in my drop top Phantom, down Wilshire boulevard,
We can't find Biggies killers so we gave Diddy a star,
And I'm by far, Hollywood boulevard,
But I'm from a boulevard that taught yall to shoot out of moving cars,
Remember, New Jersey driver's like a East Coast menace,
And Belly was like the sequel without O-Dogg in it,
Give me a New York minute,
To show you Cali got more dead bodies then the Yankees got New York pennants,
Cause we Dodgers and Impalas with the windows tinted,
I duck shots where Venus and Sarena used to play tennis,
And they never came back, like throwin' a boomerang flat,
See me, I'm posted like a Cincinnati pitcher in the same hat,
It's like a scene from a movie, when the screen fade black,
Niggas roll up on you, Now you stuck in that Harold and Cane trap,
If you slippin' in Hollywood, and you get your chain snatched,
I know some niggas that know some niggas, I'll get your chain back.
[Chorus]
Niggas already know who had the marijuana first,
We birthed haze and sour diesel, I was there when the water burst,
Hell nah we don't surf, We half way go to church,
Tell you the truth, shit, right now I'm in the fuckin' hearse,
And it ain't my night to get buried in the dirt
But it is your day to get buried by a verse,
It'll be another ten years before you see an MC Ren here,
Where he been, I been there, that Lambo, I'm in there,
Hotter then the beginning of my career with 50, Dre and Em there,
Top off the Murcialago like Victoria's Secret swim swear,
So listen, I'm so sincere, bout to work out like gym wear,
Murder MTV's top ten, and tat my face with 10 tears,
That's 10 funerals, 10 caskets,
10 3-piece Ralph Lauren suits, 10 motorbikes stopping traffic,
And 10 reasons why I got California hotter than acid,
Don't you ever, ever leave me out of the top 10 you fuckin' bastards
Blow
[Chorus]
Picture me rollin' in that bmdub
Headed to the club
Fresh out the Tyson fight
Beamer all rimmed up
Shinin' with the big homie five car caravan
Ridin' shotgun put that chronic smoke in the air
Me against the world is what I told my foes
So it's me against the world til I poke them hos
Leanin' out the window
Flickin' ashes off the indo
Throwin' up westside I see one of my kinfolk
Put that blunt closer to my mouth cause only she knows
I'm feelin' bad about that nigga we stomped out in the casino
But fuck it, it's deathrow
The big homie never told me that my next blow would be my fuckin' death blow
Tell kadada I'm not ready I ain't even let my momma know
I ain't got no kids I'm only twenty four
Before I could let the smoke out niggas let twenty go
The thirteen that hit the car went through the passenger door
[Chorus: Latoya Williams]
Never can say goodbye
Never can say goodbye to my friends [x4]
I love it when they call me big poppa
I only smoke blunts if they rolled propa
Look I got's ta catch the first thing smokin' the cali
And hit one of my bitches in the valley
Gotta call my nigga Sean
Tell him reserve the don
Tell him to get the chron and the teflon
I think they trippin' off the homie gettin' shot
But God bless his soul, Lord knows it wasn't pop or the mafia
Kim tell cease get the fuckin' truck
We 'bout to hit the Wolersheim district get fucked up
Pop bad bottles son twist up the phillies
I'm thinkin' bout tiana these niggas is lookin' silly
If this was Brooklyn I would ump the nine milli
But fuck it we to the truck roll a dutch we outta phillies
Hop in the front seat of that dark green suburban
Heard another car swervin'
Gun shots closed my curtains
Biggie
[Chorus:]
Pull the rag off the six-fo'
Hit the switch, show niggas how the shit go
The Game is back, the Aftermath chain is gone
The D's is chrome, the frame is black
(So watch it lift up)
Till the motherfucker bounce and break
And knock both of the screws out the licence plate
Let the games begin
These other rap niggas so far behind me, go taste my rims
Shit, let the chronic burn as the Daytons spin
It ain't been this much drama since I first heard Eminem
In the club, poppin' X pills like M & Ms
Call it Dre day, we celebratin', bitch bring a friend
Bottles on me, tell the waiter to order another round
And put that cheap-ass hypnotic down
(Put your 'cris up!)
If you feel the same way
Who got 'em hittin' switches NY to LA
(If I could fit the whole hood in the club)
Hop in the low-rider, long as you got bitches in the back
(I turn it into a strip-club)
Call it a lap-dance, when the six-fo' bounce that ass
(If I could fit the hole world in the club)
Tell the DJ to bang my shit, the west-coast in this bitch
(Pop bottles and twist up)
Roll up chronic and hash
In a blunt, call it Aftermath
Somebody tell me where the drinks at
Where the bitches at
You fucking on the first night, meet me in the back
I got a pound of chronic, and a gang of freaks
Move bitch! Who the fuck you think they came to see?
The protÃ©gÃ© of the D R E
You take a picture with him, and you gotta fuck me
And you gotta fuck Busta, can't touch Eve
Got something in my waist that you can't touch either
That's â my gangsta bitch, and like Crips and Bloods
I'm in the club on some gangsta shit
(So nigga twist up)
Light another dub
Bitches get scared when niggas start fighting in the club
Ain't nothing but a g-thing, baby it's a g-thing
Bounce like you got hydraulics in your g-string
I fuck a different bitch seven days a week
Hit the switch, watch it bounce like a Scott Storch beat
(If I could fit the whole hood in the club)
Hop in the low-rider, long as you got bitches in the back
(I turn it into a strip-club)
Call it a lap-dance, when the six-fo' bounce that ass
(If I could fit the hole world in the club)
Tell the DJ to bang my shit, the west-coast in this bitch
(Pop bottles and twist up)
Roll up chronic and hash
In a blunt, call it Aftermath
Niggas thought I wasn't coming back, look at me now
Hoppin' out the same Cherry six-fo' with the motherfucking top down
I'm The Game, nigga
Call your bitch, she ain't home, she with Game, nigga
Remember that, Dre
You passed me the torch, I lit the chronic with it, now the world is my ashtray
Ridin' three-wheel motion 'till the ass scrapes
Turn sunset into a motherfucking drag-race
Now watch it bounce
Hit the switch, let it bounce till the police shut the shit down
(When you hit the club)
Tell 'em you came with me
(We gonna twist up)
In the V.I.P
It's a new day, and if you ever knew Dre
Motherfucker, you would say I was the new Dre
Same Impala, different spokes
Same chronic, just a different smoke
(If I could fit the whole hood in the club)
Hop in the low-rider, long as you got bitches in the back
(I turn it into a strip-club)
Call it a lap-dance, when the six-fo' bounce that ass
(If I could fit the hole world in the club)
Tell the DJ to bang my shit, the west-coast in this bitch
(Pop bottles and twist up)
Roll up chronic and hash
In a blunt, call it Aftermath
Come on tuff guy, you talk so much shit
You run your mouth day and night, it's just a bunch of shit
Why don't you go and say it to their face
Instead of talking behind their back
All you do is tellin' lies, that's all you know how to do
Just keep fuckin' with me, I dare you
You've got no clue, your head's up your ass
You just want attention, I bet you were the nerd of your class
Back up your words or shut the hell up
This time you're gonna learn because I've had enough
Turn and run as far as you can, you're gonna have to
Or you can stay here, I dare you
You make me wanna puke, you're such a stupid joke
You brag that you can do this and that
I can see through your disguise, your master of lies
Get away from me, I can't see your face
Start to walk out, just get out of this place
You tried to bullshit me, but I knew
A fist in your mouth, rip off your face
Kick you in the head, you fuckin disgrace
You're so stupid, don't know how to dress
Your hair hasn't been washed for about a month
Come over here and I'll give you a kick in the butt
You want to act so cool, you're out of luck
Why don't you just leave, it's the best thing you could do
Or stay another minute, I dare you
Come on tuff guy, you talk so much crap
You run your mouth day and night, it's just a bunch of shit
Why don't you go and say it to their face
Instead of talking behind their back
All you do is tellin' lies, that's all you know how to do
Just keep fuckin' with me, I dare you
I won't pull the trigger
Just to see you die
No remedy to make me come alive
I'm ticking like a timebomb
(Need) no fuse, just guts and gore
(To) initiate the burning of the core
I count down to zero, pull the trigger, no parole
No mercy, have mercy, no mercy on your soul
Kill by any means necessary
Win by any means necessary
Live by any means necessary
Die by any means necessary
I am not judgemental
A sinner nor a saint
'Cause either you're my best friend or you ain't
Come gather here around me
Feel my breath under your skin
I'm deadly, only when I'm getting caught
I count down to zero, I'm a soldier without soul
No mercy, have mercy, no mercy on your soul
Kill by any means necessary
Win by any means necessary
Live by any means necessary
Die by any means necessary
I am born to kill - judge and condemn
I am born to win - slay and maim 'em
I am born to live - fight for glory
I am born to die
Kill - win - live - die
Kill by any means necessary
Win by any means necessary
Live by any means necessary
Die by any means necessary
I am born to kill - judge and condemn
I am born to win - slay and maim 'em
I am born to live - fight for glory
I am born to die - memento mori
I am born to kill - judge and condemn
I am born to win - slay and maim 'em
I am born to live - fight for glory
I am born to die - memento mori...
Lyrics to Certified Gangsta :
[Intro: G.A.M.E. (Jim Jones)]
(R.I.P Eazy-E)That Westside(Capo), that city where them tec's fly(Dip-set!)
We ride in that Westside(Eastside), that no seeds in our stress side(Lets ride)
[Verse 1: G.A.M.E.]
Jim Jones swirvin, I got that purple I'm blowed
Tight grip on the Escalade pole
Yeah, Harlem's jus' like Compton, that's jus' how I roll
Red bandana wrapped around the chrome .44
Gun smokin' like Suge cigar
Show me how you stunt you thrown outta movin' car
If that thing come out, its murder she wrote
If Doc come out, its 30 Impalas on the boat
Nigga, we do this everyday
Llamas under the thermul, waitin' by ya stairs like Mary J
Beat niggaz ride dirty like Jazze Pha, Cassius Clay
Knock a nigga out on the ave today
Bring the mack ya way me and Santana
Blowin' in the crowd like Donnie Hathaway
Westside blood-gang, niggaz know what I'm about
And they know I'm ruff ridin' so they knockself out
[Chorus: Bezel]
Now I ride with my vest, .45 and my tech
Big 4 in the '64, like I'm in the West
Not petrified to put 5 in ya chest
Cause, we Certified Gangstas
Stash the mill' in the house
And I kill in the drowt
That's the chill, when I pump, get it crunk in the South
Icegrill, like a nice meal in my mouth
Cause, we Certified Gangstas
PARTY!...PARTY!
PARTY!...PARTY!
[Verse 1]
Me and my G boys rush through the door
Time to get rowdy, we's about to take the floor
Gotta let em' know, represent, throw ya hood up
I yell "Where my G's at" and the whole club stood up
We bout to blow it out, these women lookin' stout
We fixin' to break em' off cause that's what we all about
The party don't stop, pop the top on the Moet
And if we run out, I got plenty we can go get
Diamonds on my neck, golds in my mouth
This is how we do it deep, down in the South
Candy paint jobs with the twenties on the Chevy
Plenty Optimos cause you know we rollin' heavy
You never can suspend me, you always see me rippin'
I keep the yok stashed just in case they start trippin'
In the parking lot hit the brakes to the beat
With Versace on my back and them gators on my feet
[Hook]
But cha' know it ain't nothin' but a gangsta party (PARTY!)
It ain't nothin' but a gangsta party (PARTY!)
It ain't nothin' but a gangsta party (PARTY!)
It ain't nothin' but a gangsta party (PARTY!)
It ain't nothin' but a gangsta party (PARTY!)
It ain't nothin' but a gangsta party (PARTY!)
It ain't nothin' but a gangsta party (PARTY!)
It ain't nothin' but a gangsta party (PARTY!)
[Verse 2]
Welcome every hood from all around the city
The women lookin' good even though they ain't sedity
Chronic in my system, liquor in my cup
Ya better take cover, we about to blow it up
Buck jumpin' to the beat, we all off in the street
We see it's all love but we still pack the heat
We keep it sucker free, steady firin' bud up
We all pimp sharp, we ain't tryin' to tear the club up
Down for whatever, styled women all around
Rollers in the back breakin' trees off of pounds
Niggas from the Mound, niggas from Blackhaven
We toss it up like Pac cause it ain't no ho savin'
Sippin' Alize, chiefin' hay with my click
V.I.P. section cause ya know we roll thick
20 deep on the creep, tryin' to get em' in
Drunk as a skunk still sippin' on gin
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Me and my G boys rush through the door
Time to get rowdy, we's about to take the floor
Gotta let em' know, represent, throw ya hood up
I yell "Where my G's at" and the whole club stood up
We bout to blow it out, these women lookin' stout
We fixin' to break em' off cause that's what we all about
The party don't stop, pop the top on the Moet
And if we run out, I got plenty we can go get
Diamonds on my neck, golds in my mouth
This is how we do it deep, down in the South
Candy paint jobs with the twenties on the Chevy
Plenty Optimos cause you know we rollin' heavy
You never can suspend me, you always see me rippin'
I keep the yok stashed just in case they start trippin'
In the parking lot hit the brakes to the beat
With Versace on my back and them gators on my feet
[Hook]
[The Game]
Yo I'm hoping out a Phantom with a' iced out medallion
Stallions on both arms, rocks on both charms
My Dominican chick looking like Scarface sister
Red and curly and she wake me up early
Cause hustlers hit the block when police change shifts
New York, California different toilet, same shit
In Brooklyn I rock Timberlands
Still toast cinnamon
Been gangster way before he dropped many men
Liquor in my system, voice raspy who I sound like?
Don't ask me that's my nigga we classy
Him and Montega Jada our style superior to haters
You can catch me in the latest Marvin Gaters
Ralph Lauren suit tape it up fly cause I'm papered up
Why these niggas keep hating on my Phantom
I be out in Atlanta and body tapping I'm probably strapped
Toast it up niggas
[Chorus: Chrisette Michelle]
All my hoods on the real dark side of the track
No sunny sky's just really black
We live real down here, Lord let us live
No playing around here, Lord let us live
Don't hate my hood just hate my shine
We coming out we on our grind
We live real down here, Lord let us live
We coming outta here, Lord let us live
[The Game]
Now who the fuck want war with the human gun store?
Gangsta rap is where I live just knock on the front door
Niggas stunt more than Jackie Chan
What the fuck them faggots saying?
Nothing when I walk in the club with the gat in hand
Take 'em back to '94 shooing out a Astro van
Banging was the blueprint money was the master plan
Duffel bag full of Grants and Franklins
Rob niggas take they money shoot straight to the bank then
Head to the barbershop to get chopped up
Hearing war stories who dead and who locked up
Who snitching, who pitching and who knocked up
Fuck niggas in Black Wall Street I trust
Black hoodies and black Asics standing on the pavement
Hustlers don't sleep nigga we work the grave shift
Fuck that long money nigga get paid quick
And don't save shit
[Chorus: Chrisette Michelle]
Lord knows that money don't matter
Lord knows that status is badder
Lord knows about the hood I live in
He's taking away but he's giving
Now don't give me these cars
Don't give me these mansions
Don't hate me just let me ride, Lord just give me light
[The Game]
I don't hate Mobb Deep or M.O.P
That was a phase I was caught up in the beef like a rat in a maze
And my legacy will never be that of a hater
Lyrical rhyme slayer wack niggas say your prayers
It's the return of Gandhi
Criminal minded city behind me
Put it on my face to remind me
Of all the shit I been through my physical presence, my pen too nice
My first album sent you life
I should of put down the mic when Rakim left Dre
No cleanup hitter so I was stranded on second base
I had to steal third motherfucker that's my word
There's some Queens niggas try to put me back on the curb
I was ultimate warrior to you bully ass niggas
I will come through the hood with the fully axe niggas
Like Snoop or Suge I'm in the coupe I'm good
Mothafuckas make way
[Chorus: Chrisette Michelle]
[The Game]
Is that Michelle Chrisette
Black Wall, Coollie High, Scott Storch, let's ride '08 to infinity
California, New York
Scott Storch, Scott Storch...
(Keyshia Cole)
I will always love you

(The Game)
(Verse 1)
You know what they

Means more marijuana and less baby momma
You know I love you like I love my shoes
But even all Nike air forces come in two
I like her and I like you 2
Whats wrong
she ma bitch and you ma boo
She gotta CLS and you gotta a Bentley Coup
She take all my clothes to the cleaners
And you take them to school
I gave you a Berkley bag
I made a mistake
And Oprah dont fuck wit them no more anyway
I know you get sick and tired of me cheating
But you forgave me
After i fucked mya
Sorry for the bullshit I put you through
I aint gonna no where I got a kid wit you
She always say jay got beyonce and wayne
I just turn the volume up and let Keyshia Cole sing
(Chrous)
(Verse 2)
Dre told me "Its the power of the P.U.S.S.Y"
That have a nigga daydreaming in the S.K.Y
I cant replace you ur man and put you in the S5
But I can make sure when i hit
They can hear you in bedstuy
That's B
You kno how I do
How your girlfriends get to hate Wen I ride through
Like he fucked her at wats her name
record release party
I rather fuck with rihanna and I dont even know shawty
My alibe is I had to lie
I kiss and dont tell and hit and oh well
I make the boat sail
and ditched the hotel
If a man got a problem
get hit with doch shells
Then after the hotel
Its the after party
With IV's in his wrist
While I'll leave with his Bitch
Blow the roof
Let her feel the breeze in the 6
They said R&b; dead
But keyshia that bitch
(Chrous)
(Verse 3)
Its money that makes 7 days change
From puerto rico to watch a lakers game
I give my heart and my house and chain
Just to she your face when the roses came
You wanted me to meet your family Im on the next plane to eat dinner With your mom and P.F change
She said she will die for you and I told her I'll do the same
And i feel it in her eyes
She can see my pain
I told you I had a son
You wanted to kno his name
Harlem
But my fans call him baby game
Before his birth I was against all odds in the streets
Me and, micheal,face dodging police
My baby momma play games with me
So me and her
Like ciara and bow wow
We like Nas and Kelis
In London i told you I would give you the world
I was your LL
And you were my around the way girl
(Chrous)
These niggas ain't bigger than me
These niggas ain't Nas, ain't Jigga to me
These niggas ain't Em, they ain't 50 to me
You ain't Pun, you ain't Pac, you ain't Biggie to me
These niggas ain't Crips, they ain't 60's to me
These niggas ain't Bloods, they ain't dripping with me
Niggas talking that shit 'bout the new generation, man
Fuck these niggas, I'll slash your fucking faces
You niggas ain't sold shit, not an album or a rock
Pussy nigga putting rings on my old bitch
Dick down the throat ass niggas, old ho' ass niggas
Happy cause you went gold ass niggas
These niggas ain't spitting with me, you ain't sicker than me
Fuck out my section you ain't sitting with me
This for very important people, it's clear that we not equal
Clear you niggas faggots, I'm the black Marshall Mathers
Like "ying, ying, ying" on a motherfucker
Who needs Hulk Hogan when you got Sting on this motherfucker?
Less than five albums, Kiss the Ring on this motherfucker
California throne and I'm the King on this motherfucker
I don't wanna hear it, weak ass lyrics
Crying on the hook, thinking we gon' feel it
Old lost ass niggas, voice crack when you talk ass niggas
Rolling blunts for the boss ass niggas
I came in with 'Ye, Jeezy and boss ass niggas
Your Freshman cover a whole bunch of soft ass niggas
Tampon lyricists, evacuate the premises
Mute BET Cyphers, cause I don't wanna hear that shit
May you Rest in Piss, you fuck niggas, eh
Frank Ocean go ahead and fuck these niggas
(Yeah, they fuck niggas) Ain't no 3 stacks in your class
Take your Top 10 spot and shove it up your ass, bitch boy
Niggas already fucked your bitch, you bitch boy
And every time you kiss on that ho, you suck my dick, you bitch boy
And when you buy that ho a bag that bitch carry my bricks, you bitch boy
I was in the XXL, red chucks 'round my neck
I was the G in the Unit, had Buck round my set
Word to the Rhymes, had Busta Bust round my set
Gave Whoo Kid a Glock in case they bust round my set
I'm from Compton where that Glock can't fuck with that Tec
That's some Bompton, 40 Glocc got socked in his neck
This a spawn in the flesh, you a pawn hit reset
Five in the chest, I'm Makaveli the Don and the vet
Don't say "What's up" when you see me, you a pussy nigga
Stranget, fake ass Kanye, fake ass Weezy
Fake ass jewelry, how I know? I'm at the pawn shop
Nigga better off jacking Flav for his alarm clock
Speaking of time, how much more 'til the Game drop
So you can suck my dick and Complex can count my name drops
I been the underdog, I'm cool in the dog house
Fuck all these pussys, give me any name to call out
Left Aftermath, Dre told me ball out
Stunna put me on a private jet then we balled out
Landed in Miami, met some bitches ate 'em all out
Black Marshall Mathers, time to show 'em what it's all 'bout
"Ying, ying, ying" on a motherfucker
"Ying, ying, ying" on a motherfucker
These niggas ain't bigger than me
These niggas ain't Nas, ain't Jigga to me
These niggas ain't Em, they ain't 50 to me
You ain't Pun, you ain't Pac, you ain't Biggie to me
These niggas ain't Crips, they ain't 60's to me
These niggas ain't Bloods, they ain't dripping with me
Niggas talking that shit 'bout the new generation
Ol' emoji ass rappers, all these smiley ass faces
Ay Frank Ocean go ahead and fuck these fuck niggas
Yeah they fuck niggas
"Ying, ying, ying" on a motherfucker
"Ying, ying, ying" on a motherfucker
"Ying, ying, ying" on a motherfucker

The industry soft, I should let Miguel sing on this motherfucker
Ride out
Blood money, we gon' ride out
Ride out
And don't think I won't send six niggas to your hide out
Rich Gang
Beast on the loose and my stomach is rumblin'
These niggas out here is food for my stomach
Get the fuck out the way when the lions is comin'
The elephant's stompin', gorillas is jumpin'
The snakes full of venom, the wolves out and huntin'
In this concrete jungle, in this concrete jungle, woo
In this concrete jungle, in this concrete jungle, woo
I sink in my teeth cause these niggas is sweet
Predator to the prey, you should pray for the weak
Spray out Caprices, drive by with the reaper
I hang out the window like I'm an AC
Bodies turn cold after losing your pulse
Turn that dude to a ghost like the homie SP
Yeah, from the LAX with these bars I keep locked
Ain't a prison, I'm free, I can rap in my sleep
Dude on the post with rocks using shots
They come back to your ass like an offensive rebound
Funeral home on the speed dial
When God call your number
Man, trust me, there won't be no re-dial
We out here every day, they acting senile
Year of the wolf, niggas 'bout to hear me out
This beat I'mma wreck while these gorillas beat on their chest
West swing, I'm knocking their trees down
So go in your temple
These niggas is dinner from January all the way to December
Shouldn't have played with my killers
Beast on the loose and my stomach is rumblin'
These niggas out here is food for my stomach
Get the fuck out the way when the lions is comin'
The elephant's stompin', gorillas is jumpin'
The snakes full of venom, the wolves out and huntin'
In this concrete jungle, in this concrete jungle, woo
In this concrete jungle, in this concrete jungle, woo
Real trill nigga with a hip hand trigger
I'm surrounded by the killers, I just got it like that
Rappers always talking, you ain't 'bout it like that
Coward out the hood to get it then I brought it right back
Blood money rider, keep the chopper right beside 'em
FMN fully loaded, that's for any nigga want it
This sound like I got the shit, but fact it don't it
Grab a cork, get to sparkle, talking like one of my opponents
Rate these haters above 'em
You talk some cash when you talk to me
I ain't got no love for you if you ain't getting guwop with me
All my niggas from day one gwho I'm gon take to the top with me
And this shotty on me, got the boy, I walk this so [?]

Soo Woo!
Never been so hurt
There was no one to care
Since my very first breath on Earth
There was no one ever there
My father left me when I was 7, at a home
Left me but took his chrome, I looked up and blood was gone
Man, fuck it, guess in the world I'm all alone
My mother was too naive so when he left she followed along
And while you're listenin' to this song, askin' yourself why
It's really none of your business but I was there, I bear witness
To a grow fuckin' man with a bid
Unzipped his pants and I can't tell you what a pig
Me and my sister had different fathers, but I cared, and I loved her
And I'd be lyin' if I said I wasn't scared, when he rubbed her
Tip of his penis on her, she was only 11
How could you ever get a boner?
Even thinkin' about it make me hot as a sauna
Make me wanna pop him like the top on Coronas
But I was scared, ran back to my room, prayed to God
That I was dreamin', can't believe I'm this nigga's semen
Livin' with demons and it'd been that way
Never been so hurt
There was no one to care
(Don't give a fuck about me)
Since my very first breath on Earth
There was no one ever there
(Don't give a fuck about me)
These niggas can't fuck with this shit
I'll make you slit your wrist
This, sort of like the exodus
It's, you see it
The moon bleedin', it's a bloody moon
You see it
It's a bloody moon
You see it
It's a bloody moon
The moon bleedin', it's a bloody moon
Our Lord, grant us good in this world
And good in the life, to come keep us safe from the torment of the fire
As we keep our hands up high and scream for justice
Ferguson, rest in peace Mike Brown
And all the young soldiers out there
God help us
Time to take a stand and save our future
Like we all got shot, we all got shot
Throwing up our hands don't let them shoot us
'Cause we all we got, we all we got
God ain't put us on the Earth to get murdered, it's murder
God ain't put us on the Earth to get murdered, it's murder
Don't point your weapons at me
Seen the pictures, feel the pain, scandalous how they murder son
Tired of them killing us, I'm on my way to Ferguson
Talked to TIP, I talked to Diddy, them my brothers walking with me
Mothers crying "Stop the riots", we ain't got to chalk the city
I seen Cole out there, felt I should go out there
They left that boy for hours in the cold out there
They killin' teens, they killin' dreams (It's murder)
Yo, come on we gotta stick together, we all we got
Police taking shots and I ain't talkin' 'bout Ciroc
I'm talking 'bout Emmett Till, I'm talking bout Ezell Ford
I'm talking 'bout Sean Bell, they never go to jail for
Trayvon over Skittles, Mike Brown Cigarillos
History keeps repeating itself, like a Biggie instrumental
America's a glass house and my revenge is mental
Rather use my brain than throw a cocktail through a window
I got the keys to the city still we left in the cold
Hands in the sky, still was left in the road
Ribbon in the sky, Michael Brown, another soul
Stole by the system, black men we pay the toll
The price is your life, Uncle Sam want a slice
Black dress code now we looting in the night
Now we throwing Molotovs in this holocaust
And I know they hate to hear me screaming, "I'm a Boss!"
Time to take a stand and save our future
Like we all got shot, we all got shot
Throwing up our hands don't let them shoot us
'Cause we all we got, we all we got
God ain't put us on the Earth to get murdered, it's murder
God ain't put us on the Earth to get murdered, it's murder
Don't point your weapons at me
Tired of the okie-dokie, lying you Pinocchio
Driving while black, tell me, where am I supposed to go?
Gun shots hit the car, now I got the holy ghost
If excessive force was a drug, then they overdosed
Got us tryin'a protest, it's a slow process
Heard it's a lot of rotten eggs in the crow's nest
People praying on they feet, police holding on they heat
Turned on the news and seen a tank rolling down the street (Yeah)
I seen a lot of ice water tossed, and I know it's for a cause
My only question is, what we doing for the loss
Of Mike Brown, 'cause right now, I challenge you to use your talents to
Speak up, and don't you ever let them silence you
'Cause action speaks louder than words, that's what I heard
Shot down with his hands up, that's what occurred
Man that sound absurd
Matter fact to me that sound like murder
We want justice
Ay yo Game, I had a crib out there, I used to live out there
So I know how niggas feel out there
People stressing, protesting, unity is a blessing
So it's time we come together, use our voice as a weapon
I am Michael Brown, 'cause I stand for what he stand for
News say we're looting, paint pictures like we some animals
On my NWA CMG
Hollin' "Rest in peace Eazy and fuck the police"
Heard another brother slain up in St. Louis
Sure the mother feel the pain, but what you famous doing?
I'm sure the general population trying to be more active
But when the light finally catches you, you ice challenge
Okay, and I support the ALS just like the rest of them
But you have yet to pay your debt, so you just flexing then
'Cause everybody care for a minute, then stop
People only there for a minute, then stop
And what's the point of giving if you ain't giving your all?
We never getting ahead, might as well give up your heart
Where does it end?
I got my hands up, what else am supposed to do? (Rest in peace to Mike Brown)
Where does it end? (And all the other fallen soldiers)
Tell me, where's the love for everything we're going through? (That will not be on the news or televised, ah)
Mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy me
Hope that God can save us
Mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy me (As we lead in peace)
Martin Luther King had a dream!
But they ain't respecting Jesse up out here
And they don't really respect Obama out here
Lights out, go dark it's like a nightmare
How the fuck you play the game, but they ain't playing fair
It's going down, Armageddon right here
Right now, not on TV, but right here
Put your flags in the air if you don't really care (Wave it)
We need justice, yeah, we need justice here
I heard he surrendered but we all saw how they did him
Television broadcasts, a confused country
I'm a resident of a nation that don't want me
What's done is done, the town erupts in fury
And I'm already hearing 'bout this lopsided jury
Three faces like his, the rest another story
A lot of motherfuckers need to act more worried
The revolution has been televised
If I sit here and do don't do nothing, homie, that's genocide
Fuck that, we have arrived!
And who cares who ain't on our side 'cause we on our own
How do you preach peace to a family that just lost they own?
My brodie Game just banged my line like "We gotta do something"
All that marching and that peace ain't gonna fucking do nothing
Fuck it, my moms, sorry, I'm ready to rage
The police done let the animals out of the cage, oh Lord it's
Time to take a stand and save our future
Like we all got shot, we all got shot
Throwing up our hands don't let them shoot us
'Cause we all we got, we all we got
God ain't put us on the Earth to get murdered, it's murder
God ain't put us on the Earth to get murdered, it's murder
Don't point your weapons at me
Stand up

I got a black mac and a six pack
I don't work out, I don't chit chat
My bitch bad, I get racks
That Rolls Royce, come gift-wrapped
Them birds still come shrink-wrapped
I'm not strapped, don't think that
I'm low key with that click clack
That rat a tat tat tat tat
Throw the burner and I'm runnin' home
Niggas stop being loyal when the money gone
Still walk in this bitch, I'm a hundred strong
One chain on my neck, feel like I got a hundred on
Look at my flow on this bitch
Platinum and gold on my wrist
Money, the accountant be countin' it
That's why I'm throwin' this shit
I'm in BK with that SK
Same clothes since yesterday
With that Biggie Smalls on replay
And I ain't wearing no vest today
I do the Shmoney dance with this mac
You better do it too or get Shmurda'd
I be grilling that beef, I ain't talkin' no burgers
I finna be walkin' like I'm a New Yorker
I let off the K and then I hope in the Uber
It's never a question that I am the shooter
I empty the clip and lay you in a pool of
Blood, see how he got hit with the Ruger?
Blood, bandana that's how we be movin'
Blood, swooping from Compton to Brooklyn
And this ain't the Barclays but niggas be shootin'
Running niggas down back and forth

Shook and twist the jars
And dope on my mommas stove top
By the time she came back from church boy

Like yeah nigga, niggas keep beggin'
I pull out a pump in this bitch like I'm blizzard
Yeah, empty your pockets, we robbin'

Nigga, it's better to ask for forgiveness than ask for permission
You catchin' the hollow, I'm catchin'you slippin'
I did it alone, only God as my witness
My nigga got off cause we tied up the witness
and made sure the nigga couldn't show up in court
You know the business, them niggas find out that you snitchin'

Everyday Halloween niggas will go trick or treatin'

Flippin' a check off this rappin'

You talk that gangsta shit, but I just can't believe it bro
We pull up with them shots, knockin' out that European [?]
S to the K to the E-M-E, callin' the EMT after I empted this clip
I sold my dope right on CMT, I'm at the ING, know I'm as weird as it gets
Chuck Taylor told me it's fuck haters, so I say fuck 'em and bury these niggas in pits
Rolley on wrist, no toc or no tic, your girl on my dick, man come get your bitch
Niggas think this a rap now, I might back down and come try your luck
Riders with me be wired up, they ridin' with me till the tyres bust
Haters talkin', but they better cool it, before that nigga Crooked get fired up
Lay you out like my Balmains, you gotta play 'em straight, he get ironed up
Drinkin' lean till I'm high enough, I don't give a fuck about [?] nigga

'Sup, nigga, huh?
You know what this shit is?
Stay down and come up, (damn right)
Street niggas is street niggas alike
It ain't even one way, nigga (two niggas most)
Stay down until you come up, nigga
Four songs, nigga, (Blood Money, let's go)
Everythin' wrong, this can't be right
Man, it's so much, this can't be life (yeah)
Shit get real, me and K. on back
(Stay on back, nigga, do what you gotta do)
Never came back in that black on black
I still do it for them niggas with them bricks on bricks
I still do it for them niggas with them nicks on nicks
Let me tell you how real niggas pull a rebound back
See I never came back in that black on black
Nigga come through for a nine and a half
I'ma tell him ain't nothin' left
Nigga need an eight, tell him everythin' straight
All they gotta do it wait, tell a nigga I'm a Chef
How you think a nigga went and got that race?
Could have went to jail but I bought that case
Lawyer came through, told him it's about time
Jim Carrey to the Rollie, I just switch that switch
Put 10 karats on my daughter ear, fuck it
She deserved every rock, I done sold out in public
Do anythin' for my Destiny's Child
She a BeyoncÃ©, never be LeToya Luckett
Black on black, checkerboard Louis luggage
On a PJ feelin' like Warren Buffett
With the Minnesota Twins, ain't no Kirby Puckett
Let the shade fear clouds, tell Aaliyah that I love her
Back and forth in a Lear
My grandmother say I never see her
She want me come home on Thanksgivin'
Cause I'm black on black like, yeah
Black on black to my dear
Black on black in my ear
Black Maserati that I gave to my mama
Right hand to the throttle, she can't even find the gears
Everythin' wrong, this can't be right
Man, it's so much, this can't be life (yeah)
Shit get real, me and K. on back

See I never came back in that black on black
Hold up, hold up, hold up
Shit get real, we don't fold up
This is what I told myself in my grandma's kitchen
At the table, nigga, choppin' my blow up
Said she want to sell more like my father
Same time, had me for a couple dollars
Yeah, I'm 'bout to put on
And now I'm 'bout to kill these niggas
So you might not see me 'til tomorrow'
'til I get it, then my palms start itchin'
Soon I hit the block, then my bong gone missin'
See, I'm 'bout to take me a trip to the other side of town
And I'm goin' there to find me a chicken
Yeah, I got a nigga in the spot with a nine right now
So, I'm goin' there to sell him a pigeon
My parents told me that the money is the root of all evil
I said it is then a lil' more
If I had to be precise, tell you two things about life
Niggas win everyday, niggas fail every night
I say, "Now, Oprah got a billion dollars
And you know what near her"
Type of shit I tell myself while starin' in the mirror
What!
Everythin' wrong, this can't be right
Man, it's so much, this can't be life (yeah)
Shit get real, me and K. on back
(We gotta do what we gotta do, you feel me)

(Stay down until you come up)
Let me tell you how them real niggas pull a rebound back
(How you bounce back nigga, nigga do what?)
See I never came back in that black on black
Met man named George, straight drop, no whippin'
Electric off, everything's boilin' in the fridge
I ain't bathed in a week, I was smellin' like pickles
Street showin' no pities, still gettin' to the business
? break it down, sell nickels
Had to ball him out of jail, blew the money on the bail
When flat, bounced back from a 30-cent flipper
I don't even know a nigga livin' how I'm livin'
I don't even know how many times I've been to prison
Shit get gangsta, we call ...
Bought two things, had the third one off issue
Two-fifty-two on the scale, that's a nino
Eighteen sales, five hundred-four grams
Add an extra gram when you weigh it with the ...
Real rap talk, keep it real, don't believe you
When you get out of line, swear to God, I'ma leave you
Dirks cuts the water 'fore they kick a nigga dope
Try to flush it down the toilet but the dope just flow
Tear gas from the cannon
Everybody scramblin', but I ain't the one to panic
Double homicide, broad day, that's my jacket
Tried to bird feed, cut through on my jacket
And I take change, I'm a serve when they askin'
Come from out of town, I'ma test, none or less
Everythin' wrong, this can't be right
Man, it's so much, this can't be life (yeah)
Shit get real, me and K. on back
(We gotta do what we gotta do, you feel me)
Never came back in that black on black

Cause I don't feel you niggas
I said fuck you niggas

Don't make me kill you niggas

I told niggas in '05 I don't fuck with Maybachs
You wanna hate up, come outisde, just fuckin' say that
Two things I learned, nigga gotta stayed strapped
And niggas ain't goin' down without a Dr. Dre track
Black boy fly, niggas watch me grew
Niggas studies my beefs and couldn't stomp my flow
(Cause I'm dangerous)
Niggas think they fucking with me
(Stop smoking angel dust)
Niggas think they smoking on this chronic
(The same as us)
Come within (range of us)
Bullets (your brains are bust)
Ministers get shot, two of these niggas (came to us)
You broke your rent doing your bitch want me
I'm off this OG kush and you the lil' homie
Nigga wanna borrow some weed, I got a lil' homie
Watch how I'm driving, can't let the double cup spill on me
Same block and stop snitchin', mother fuckers still one me
G-Unit had a reunion
Man fuck you niggas

Cause I don't feel you niggas
I said fuck you niggas
I rob you niggas
Don't make me kill you niggas

I eat you alive (man fuck you niggas)
It feel like Tommy Hilfiger, fuck niggas I say it again
(Man fuck you niggas)
I feel lke Remy Ma when she got out of the jail
Look back at the prison like (man fuck you niggas)
And this time I'm going for the gusto
R.I.P. Justo, will I fall off? Fuck no
California mind nigga, pull it like a truck boat
These crips, these bloods, these esÃ©s, they playin' cut throat
You a fish out of water, every MC gets slaughtered
If you ain't Nas, Eminem or fuckin' S dot Carter
I tie up your wife, pull out my dick jack it off, kiss the knife
Before I cut her, take my jacket off, fuck her then hit the lights
Rub it in there like Detroit streets, with pictures of me
Fuck her till cops come, then I'm bustin' like
Man fuck you niggas
I rob you niggas
I kill you niggas
Cause I don't feel you niggas
I said fuck you niggas
I rob you niggas
Don't make me kill you niggas
No I don't feel you niggas
Man fuck you niggas
I remember days on Crenshaw, take a nigga Beamer
Hit the hood, take his rims off
Then hit that block, let him hear that Pac
That shit don't stop
Soo woo, new coupe, through the west side
New Benz, top down, new rims, new bitch throwin' up P's, whoo whoop
Compton niggas ain't never gon' be the same
It's in my blood, you see my veins
You see my tats, you feel my pain
You in my hood? You from a gang
You got 2 seconds to answer where you from, or you gon' see your brains
Now that you slumped I see your change
Nigga we got canals, shelves, niggas that tried, niggas that died
Niggas that fell well, off in their jail cell
Shit, we got niggas with full clips
That'll dip through you set and disappear like "Hell Rell"
No bail like the peace price
Get caught up in the middle of the street at the light, you fuckin' bean pie
Middle of your forehead nigga, that's where the beam lie
(You be ok) Cause I done seen God
Niggas sellin' crack, Dre sellin' headphones
2Pac in heaven, bumpin' Biggie "Dead Wrong"
Cherry red Impala, Bobble head red bone
I just killed a nigga on my cellphone
Puff sellin' vodka, weed got my head gone
G-Man in heaven, name on that headstone
LJ in prison, and my nigga Legs gone
I just killed a nigga on my cellphone
Stop that
Playin' chronic, blazin' chronic with the windows tinted
Cause those that don't cut the checks, the ones in yo' business
Rappers sendin' death threats but still ain't sent no killers
You take a stretch away squeeze myself, can't depend on niggas
Shit on niggas check the urinal and you'll see
That I be droppin' jewels and you should take 'em like a jewel thief
Wolves teeth is what I use to eat my fuckin' pray up with
Used to make the yayo flip now Game told me to lay your hits
Teamed up, toured the US just to let the name ring
Goin' home to fuck shit up, I did the King James thing
Steak and lobster with the gentleman, sit with a gangster posture
Blowin' all these bands fans, screamin' like it's Frank Sinatra
Made it out the South Bay village homies hate I prosper
But I don't owe you niggas shit, I'm supposed to thank my mama
Only chase for commas, got 'em in now raise the Llama
Hotter than a blazin' comet, fuckin' south central moth
Niggas sellin' crack, Dre sellin' headphones

Cherry red Impala, Bobble head red bone
