And the peaches and the mangos
You could sell for me
What do you think my brain is made for
Is it just a container for the mind
This great grey matter
Sensei replied what is your woman
Is she just a container for the child
That soft pink matter
Cotton candy Majin Buu
Close my eyes and fall into you
My god she's giving me pleasure
What if the sky and the stars are for show
And the aliens are watching live
From the purple matter
Sensei went quiet then violent
And we sparred until we both grew tired
Nothing mattered
Cotton candy maajin bu
Dim the lights and fall into you
My god giving me pleasure
Pleasure pleasure pleasure
Pleasure over matter
Since you been gone
I been having withdrawals
You were such a habit to call
I ain't myself at all had to tell myself naw
She's better with some fella with a regular job
I didn't wanna get her involved
By dinner Mr. Benjamin was sittin' in awe
Hopped into my car drove far
Far's too close and I remember
My memories no sharp
Butter knife what a life anyway
I'm building y'all a clock stop
What am I Hemingway
She had the kind of body
That would probably intimidate
Any of 'em that were un-southern
Not me cousin
If models are made for modeling
Thick girls are made for cuddlin'
Switch worlds and we can huddle then
Who needs another friend
I need to hold your hand
You'd need no other man
We'd flee to other lands
Grey matter
Blue used to be my favorite color
Now I ain't got no choice
Blue matter
You're good at being bad
You're bad at being good
For heaven's sakes go to hell
Knock knock on wood
You're good at being bad
You're bad at being good
For heaven's sakes go to hell
Knock knock knock knock on wood
Well frankly when that ocean so muhfuckin' good
Make her swab the muhfuckin' wood
Make her walk the muhfuckin' plank
Make her rob a muhfuckin' bank
With no mask on and a rusty revolver
[Verse 1]
Oh yeah
A blind boy sees a green girl
She drives a green car through a dream world
She meets up with a green club
And talks of saving the earth from itself
A blind boy saw a blue man
Who rides a blue bus through a nightmare
He leaves word to a blue home
But the blue seems different since she's passed away
And the same boy with sunken eyes saw me
And described yellow so perfectly
[Chorus]
Said he's
Watching ohhh [x3]
With eyes like sky
Eyes like I've never seen
[Verse 2]
A blind boy became a kind man
Who painted white lights on a canvas
He once said he couldn't write songs
Cause making music would be selfish
And back then he saw the flags fly
Seen them fight and divide for it
He said war is for those who foresee it
But what good is border to me yeah, yeah
And the same man with sunken eyes saw me
And described yellow so perfectly
[Chorus]
Said he's
Watching ohhh [x3]
With eyes like sky
Eyes like I've never seen
[Bridge]
I said "I wish you could see the ocean"
He said "I wish you could see hope"
I said "have you ever seen the mountain?"
He said "no, but my faith could move those"
Ohhh woah
I said "I wish you could see the stars"
He told me I should see love
Love
Oh yeah
[Chorus]
Said he's
Watching ohhh [x3]
With eyes like sky
Eyes like I've never seen
BITCH I THINK I'M TOM PETTY
Ramadan clean plates on that bronze chevy
Finna paint that gold flake on my bond girl
River's strong you can't,
Swim inside it we could
String some lights up the, hill beside it
Tonight the moon's so bright you could,
You could drive with your headlights out
'Cause a little bit of summer's what the whole year's all about
You look fine, fine, fine
Put your feet up next to mine
We can watch that water line get higher and higher
Say, say, say
Ain't it been some kind of day
You and me been catching on like a wildfire
Don't get up just to, get another you can
drink from mine, we can't, leave each other
We can dance with the dead
You can rest your head
On my shoulder if you want to get older with me
'Cause a little bit of summer makes a lot of history
You look fine, fine, fine
Put your feet up next to mine
We can watch that water line get higher and higher
Say, say, say
Ain't it been some kind of day
You and me been catching on like a wildfire
I got a rock from the river in my medicine bag
Magpie feather in his medicine bag
Say, say, say
Ain't it been some kind of day
You and me been catchin' on like a wildfire
Double D
Big full breast on my baby (yo we goin' to Florida)

Couldn't weigh the love I've got for the girl

Nothin' wrong (Nothin' wrong, ain't nothin' wrong)

Through the sky (Up in the sky)
You and I (Just you and I) are lost

Somebody told me there'd be trouble at home
'Cause we never talk a lot when we spend time alone
So how are we supposed to know know when somethin' is wrong

Walked off the stage,
In the middle of the show..

Ohhh ohh ohh... Ohhh ohh ohh... ohh ohh..
Got the keys so we're gone uh (x2)

Guys pull me over and then they ask me
If I know I'm breaking the law..
I said yeah she got my air,
And I'm running, I'm running low..
Where my driver go? Men I don't care..
I got the keys, so I'm driving alone uh..
And try to be ready when I get there,
In front of your door, oh baby get in..
I'm ready to breathe in that good air,

Look, maybe I should just be clear,
It sucks not having you here..
There aint a better way to say it,
Other than how I just said it there..
Like a bottle of Evian you can see through me,
my ego aint here..
So many clever words and nice things ,
That I could say ...but the truth then
And the truth now and the truth now has been the same.
The hardest thing to say is what I aint saying,
And the best way to say it, it is to just say it...
Wanna run away from the words ,
But I can't run away from the world
Cause the hardest thing to say is usually worth saying..
Girl I love you.. still..
I try to go some months without a call,
I mean I'm an attractive guy and all..
Ohh yeah ,yeah, yeah..
Maybe I can find something in the club,
Or something in the mall.. mall.. mall..
But them girls didnt matter and
This money aint distracting me much at all..
I know some clever words and nice things ,
that I could say.. but the truth then
And the truth then and the truth now have been the same.. ohhh
The hardest thing to say is what I aint saying,
And the best way to say it, it is to just say it...
Wanna run away from the words,
But I cant run away from the world
Cause the hardest thing to say is usually worth saying..
Girl I love you..
But girl I wanted to cry but I made it look easy..
To hold it in and save face..
And it was harder to stay so I made it look easy..
To just get up and walk away..
Now I'm alone and the tears do fall, ( they do fall)
Holding my mouth and the words do fall..
Now I'm standing here after all..
Broken heart, but I'm strong and hard..
The hardest thing to say is what I aint saying,
And the best way to say it, it is to just say it...
Wanna run away from the words,
But I can't run away from the world
Cause the hardest thing to say is usually worth saying..
Girl I love you..
Still..
Could this be Earth? Could this be light?
Does this mean everything is going to be alright?
When I look out my window there's trees talking like people
I've dreamt of storms, I've dreamt of sound
I've dreamt of gravity, keeping us around
I've slept in the darkness, it was lonely, and it was silent
What is this love? I don't feel the same
Don't believe what this is, could be given a name
I woke, you were there, tracing planets on my forehead
But I'll forget 23 like I forgot 17
And I forget my first love, like you forget a daydream
And what of all my wild friends, and the times I've had with them
We'll all fade to grey soon, on the TV station
Swag Swag (Times 2)
don't cry cause I'm strong
I don't cry cause nothing lasts forever
I don't cry cause the kids are grown
I don't cry at all
I don't cry cause them days are gone
Oooh child, child
And when the sun sets just right oh I might
Shed a tear
And when the good word hits home I shed a tear
I shed two tears
I won't cry in the car
I wont cry in the bathroom stall
I wont cry when I'm home alone
I wont cry at all
I wont cry cause them days are gone
Ohhh, child, oooo ooh baby don't
But when them stars shine too beautiful at night
I shed two tears
And when the good word hits home I shed two more tears
Now thats four tears
Got enough. No more tears
You've had enough
Thats four tears
Mosh pits and bare chest
Stage diving sky diver
Spray the crowd with cold water
Now its mosh pits and wet tits
I think I need a cold shower
Cool waters
African girl speaks in English accent
Likes to fuck boys in bands
Likes to watch westerns
And ride me without the hands
Show me her passport
She's on her own tour
But you're beautiful to me
Wave 'em high girl to the sky
But you're beautiful to me
We're in the clouds
Wave 'em high girl to the sky
But you're beautiful to me
Life in the clouds
Keep em high y'all
Beautiful stars
In the sky
Monks in the mosh pit
Stage diving Dahli Lama
Feet covered in cut flowers
They mosh for enlightenment
Clean chakra good karma
One with the water
Indian girl sleeps above the temple
Planning a run away young at heart
You found a boyfriend
And now you wanna get away, get away
Just a virgin lover on a getaway, get away
And at sunset they're gonna try and get away, get away
Abhaya Mudra
I never ask for much
But please keep up lover
We've got no choices left
The running's fast
Run run run run
You're beautiful to me
Run run run run you'd better run
You mean so much to me
In my world, in my world
We made it safely
Even with your father's army trailing us
We escaped him
Even with his archer's bows at our backs
What a great escape
But there's a long way still in fact
We're lost in a jungle underneath these clouds
There's a monsoon that never ends
A coke white tiger woke us from our slumber
To guide and protect us til the end
We're in the clouds
Wave 'em high now, to the sky
But you're beautiful to me
Keep em high y'all, show you right
But you're beautiful to me
Beautiful
[ Verse 1]:
Do you remember, That October night
The twenty ninth, I almost lost my life
Call myself being a hero trying to guard your heart
No matter how hard I fought, it was over before it started..
I thought that we were
[Pre Hook]:
On the same side of the battle
Oh, I'm on the front line of disaster
Now it all makes sense, I've put it together
I guess what we have doesnt matter..
[Hook]:
You have me dying every night , just because
You got me fighting every night, to prove my love
We never giving up from fighting in the club
I'm dying for your love, I don't know what you want
You got me fighting every night..to prove my love
[Verse 2]:
All I ever did was just try to play my part
Try to be the man who would not let you get taken advantage of
But you let it go on, and every time I see you with him
I wanna crack his dome ( T-tell me that I'm wrong )
But I thought we were
[Hook]:
On the same side of the battle
Oh, I'm on the front line of disaster
Now it all makes sense, I've put it together
Guess what we have doesn't matter..
[Hook]:
You have me dying every night , just because
You got me fighting every night, to prove my love
We never giving up from fighting in the club
I'm dying for your love I don't know what you want
You got me fighting every night..to prove my love
[Bridge]:
You have me dying...
Fighting...every night
Dying....
Fighting...every night
[Hook]
[Outro]:
On the same side of the battle, oh....
Fertilizer
Ill take bullshit if thats all you got
Some fertilizer
Fertilizer
Ooooooo
We once had things in common
Now the only thing we share is the refrigerator
Ice cold, baby, I told you, I'm ice cold (ice cold!)
You out here flyin' high (high!)
Go head, fly that thing!
High! High!
But fly alone
You always smokin' in the house
What if my mother comes over?
You can't get up and get a job
Cause this little hustle's getting you by
You're the dealer and the stoner with the sweetest kiss around
I know what I was on, I had a Pilot Jones
She took me high, then she took me home
Pilot Jones, Pilot Jones
Tonight she came stumblin' across my lawn again
I just don't know why I keep on tryin' to keep a grown woman sober
See there you go reachin' up your blouse and no I don't want a child
But I ain't been touched in a while by the dealer
And the stoner with the sweetest kiss I've ever known
I know what I was on, I had a Pilot Jones
She took me high, then she took me home
Pilot Jones, Pilot Jones
In the sky up above, the birds
I saw the sky like I never seen before
You thought I was above you
Above this in so many ways
But if I got a condo on a cloud
Then I guess you can stay at my place
Ooh I'ma get one
I need ya
Admit it
You're my Pilot Jones
Stop thinking of this as being money
It's just money, I'mma make more
Please decondition yourself
It's the difference between happy, being happy and sad
It's the difference between having a home and living on the streets
That's what it is, it's not just money
It's so much more than that
Right now it's the difference between you being able to go to a prom
And disappointing a girl
As I told you from the beginning, I don't have money
I have bills to pay, but that meant nothing to you
Ooh yeah, I'mma make myself a hot link when I get home
It meant nothing to you
Savin' my seven dollars
Darker times
They're telling boulder heavy lies
Looks like all we've got is each other
The truth is obsolete
Remember when all I had was my mother
She didn't compromise
She could recognize
Voodoo
Our daughters and our sons
Are just candles in the sun
Voodoo
Don't let him see divide
Don't you let her see divide
Voodoo
She's got the whole wide world in her juicy fruit
He's got the whole wide world in his pants
He wrapped the whole wide world in a wedding band
Then put the whole wide world on her hands
She's got the whole wide world in her hands
He's got the whole wide world in his hands
[Verse 1]
Intimate scenes,
fresh from my dreams
Of a triple X movie scene
I could care less about being seen
A higher self-esteem if you on me (Aint that the way its supposed to be?)
I say baby do your thing
Sugars so sweet, should've rot my teeth
But instead it just rottens me, yeah
Spoiled crazy
[Hook]
Public display of affection (Got em hatin)
Pointin in our direction (Watch em watch em)
Public display of affection
Makes them wish they had it this way
We be at the club, the restaraunt The grocery store or the movie
Kissin and touchin with my hands all over ya booty
Wherever it is, yes,
Ill love it truly
Your PDA-A-A, your PDA-A-A Your PDA-A-A, your PDA-A-A
[Verse 2]
Remember at the beach, we brought the sheets
And were harassed by police
Good thing we didnt go too deep
Everywhere we meet, the passion in me just screams
I just need you in my reach
Baby your suspense, is like being intense
Has got me convinced Youre the fingers to my instrument
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
From the lobby to the patio (Boy youre so crazy)
And we so compatible
From the Starbucks to the Navajo (You nasty)
And we so compatible
[Break]
The club, the restaraunt The grocery store or the movie
Kissin and touchin with my hands all over ya booty
Wherever it is, yes, Ill love it truly
Your PDA-A-A, your PDA-A-A Your PDA-A-A, your PDA-A-A
[Outro] Your PDA-A-A (I want your PDA)
Dream, Dream Dream
Dream, Dream Dream
Killer, Killer

you promised i would stop having nightmares
if i could do my best to just not believe
say, i'm infatuated with my future
so in love with tomorrow
and that tomorrow's a mystery that won't be solved
tomorrow's a rolling stone that won't be home
Never dream that you tell me lies lies lies
vicious lies looking me in my eyes lies lies
i'm running, i'm running as fast as my mind would let me
i'm running , i'm gunning dream killers on the hunt for me
i'm running. i'm running, wont never let them get me
i'm running , i'm running dream killa dream killa killa
Vilian ,with a dagger was chasing me
i woke you and you were standing right there
you kissed me and said that's just a bad one babe
then i asked you what is that in your hand
you told me, i'm infatuated with my future
too in love with tomorrow
you said tomorrow's mystery that won't be solved
tomorrow's a rolling stone that won't be home
Never dream that you tell me lies, lies, lies
Vicious lies looking me in my eyes lies lies
i'm running, i'm running as fast as my mind would let me
i'm running , i'm gunning dream killers on the hunt for me
i'm running. i'm running, wont never let them get me
i'm running , i'm running dream killa dream killa killa
i'm gonna sleep good as soon as you're gone (Hey)
but i can't dream good as long as , long as
i'm running, i'm running as fast as my mind would let me

i'm running. i'm running, wont never let them get me

They look like twins
That was embarrassing

voodoo
our daughters and our sons

voodoo
dont let him see divide
dont you let her see divide
voodoo
shes got the whole wide world in her juicy fruit

Taxi driver
You're my shrink for the hour
Leave the meter running
It's rush hour
So take the streets if you wanna
Just outrun the demons, could you?
He said allahu Akbar, I told him don't curse me
But boy you need prayer, I guess it couldn't hurt me
If it brings me to my knees
It's a bad religion
This unrequited love
To me it's nothing but
A one-man cult
And cyanide in my Styrofoam cup
I could never make him love me
Never make him love me
Love me
Love me
Taxi driver
I swear I've got three lives
Balanced on my head like steak knives
I can't tell you the truth about my disguise
I can't trust no one
And you say allahu Akbar, I told him don't curse me
But boy you need prayer, I guess it couldn't hurt me
If it brings me to my knees
It's a bad religion
This unrequited love
To me it's nothing but
A one-man cult
And cyanide in my Styrofoam cup
I could never make him love me
Never make him love me
A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain in
Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but, boy, they bawl
When I'm thinkin' 'bout you (Ooh, no, no, no)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you (You know, know, know)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Do you think about me still? Do ya, do ya?
Or do you not think so far ahead? (Ahead)
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (Ooh, ooh)
Or do you not think so far ahead? (Ahead)
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (ooh, ooh)
No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kiss you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get fly it, though
I'm lyin' down thinkin' 'bout you (Ooh, no, no, no)

And a new day will bring another cryin' babe into the world

Our daughter's reachin' for the nipple cause it's time for her to eat
Tonight I'll lay her in the cradle if it's time for go to sleep

Niggas hustle every day for a beat from Ye

For that banana pudding, our piece of Americana
Our apple pie was supplied through Arm and Hammer
Straight out the kitchen, shh don't wake Nana!
Built a republic, that still stands
I'm trying to lead a nation, to leave to my little man's
Or my daughter, so I'm boiling this water
The scales was lopsided, I'm just restoring order
Hold up, here comes grandma, what's up YaYa?
What's that smell? Oh I'm just boiling some aqua
No papa, bad Santa
The streets raised me, pardon my bad manners

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
The love glows I know how love glows
Oh I know that love glows i know that love glows yeah
If we colored our white walls pitch black
Turn all the lights off and lay back
We can make love with our bare hands
We can make light out of thin air
Or we can close our eyes and sleep well
But Dreams feel realer then right now
But whatever you do don't let go
My only nightmare is waking up alone in a world where your not mine
In a room painted off white
Running out in the daylight, tryna get back to you
When I stare into your eyes, I see my real life
That's why I never sleep with my back to you
[Hook]
When I lay down, facing you
I can feel my eyelids glow (I never sleep with my back to you)
And if the sun rises, (back to you) behind you
I don't think I'd notice, no
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you, back to you
[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Laying under the covers that I stole
From your side of bed cause I got cold
You rolled over and whispered rob-robbery
So you been sleeping with a thief in your bed
Stole your heart, and your pillows
Whatever you do just don't go
Baby the worse jail is waking up alone in a world where your not mine
In a room painted off white
Running out in the daylight, tryna get back to you
When I'm looking in your eyes, I see my real life
So I never sleep with my back to you
[Hook]
When I lay down, facing you
I can feel my eyelids glow (I never sleep with my back to you)
And if the sun rises (back to you) behind you
I don't think I'd notice, no (I never sleep with my back to you)
[Bridge]
Like a nightlight, like a Teddy bear
Like a toddlers blanket
Look at us baby, two grownups acting like children
[Hook]
When I lay down, facing you
I can feel my eyelids glow (I never sleep with my back to you)
And if the sun rises, (back to you) behind you
I don't think I'd notice though (I never sleep with my back to you, back to you)
When I lay down, facing you
I can feel my eyelids glow (I never sleep with my back to you)
And if the sun rises, (back to you) behind you
I don't think I'd notice, no (I never sleep with my back to you, back to you)
Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no lucky charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends
Start my day up on the roof
There's nothing like this type of view
Point the clicker at the tube
I prefer expensive news
New car, new girl
New ice, new glass
New watch, good times babe
It's good times, yeah
She wash my back three times a day
This shower head feels so amazing
We'll both be high, the help don't stare
They just walk by, they must don't care
A million one, a million two
A hundred more will never do
Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce

Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Oh, real love
Close your eyes for what you can't imagine, we are the xany gnashing
Caddy smashing, bratty ass, he mad, he snatched his daddy's Jag
And used the shit for batting practice, adamant and he thrashing
Purchasing crappy grams with half the hand of cash you handed
Panicking, patch me up, Pappy done latch keyed us
Toying with Raggy Anns and mammy done had enough
Brash as fuck, breaching all these aqueducts; don't believe us
Treat us like we can't erupt, yup
We end our day up on the roof
I say I'll jump, I never do
But when I'm drunk I act a fool
Talking 'bout , do they sew wings on tailored suits
I'm on that ledge, she grabs my arm
She slaps my head
It's good times, yeah
Sleeve rips off, I slip, I fall
The market's down like 60 stories
And some don't end the way they should
My silver spoon has fed me good
A million one, a million cash
Close my eyes and feel the crash
Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no lucky charms
The maids come around too much

And the peaches and the mangos
You could sell for me
What do you think my brain is made for
Is it just a container for the mind
This great grey matter
Sensei replied what is your woman
Is she just a container for the child
That soft pink matter
Cotton candy Majin Buu
Close my eyes and fall into you
My god she's giving me pleasure
What if the sky and the stars are for show
And the aliens are watching live
From the purple matter
Sensei went quiet then violent
And we sparred until we both grew tired
Nothing mattered
Cotton candy maajin bu
Dim the lights and fall into you
My god giving me pleasure
Pleasure pleasure pleasure
Pleasure over matter
Since you been gone
I been having withdrawals
You were such a habit to call
I ain't myself at all had to tell myself naw
She's better with some fella with a regular job
I didn't wanna get her involved
By dinner Mr. Benjamin was sittin' in awe
Hopped into my car drove far
Far's too close and I remember
My memories no sharp
Butter knife what a life anyway
I'm building y'all a clock stop
What am I Hemingway
She had the kind of body
That would probably intimidate
Any of 'em that were un-southern
Not me cousin
If models are made for modeling
Thick girls are made for cuddlin'
Switch worlds and we can huddle then
Who needs another friend
I need to hold your hand
You'd need no other man
We'd flee to other lands
Grey matter
Blue used to be my favorite color
Now I ain't got no choice
Blue matter
You're good at being bad
You're bad at being good
For heaven's sakes go to hell
Knock knock on wood
You're good at being bad
You're bad at being good
For heaven's sakes go to hell
Knock knock knock knock on wood
Well frankly when that ocean so muhfuckin' good
Make her swab the muhfuckin' wood
Make her walk the muhfuckin' plank
Make her rob a muhfuckin' bank
With no mask on and a rusty revolver
I got a question I wanna ask my momma
But shes been gone for some years now
I need the answers I want to ask my friends
But they're to cool to be honest
And she's gone take it the wrong way if I question her
It just might break her heart man
I can't ask my girl
[Hook]
So I'm gonna ask Lennon
And I'mma ask Donny
And I'mma ask Stevie

Tell me tell me

[Verse 2:Frank Ocean]
Who the hell knows who Purple Rain is?
And am I standing in it?

And I feel like I need them

But I gotta know for sure
So I'm gonna ask Lennon

Ohh suddenly I caught yea, with a hook line and sinker
You were swimming in the bottom (yea)
I said why you gonna live down there
Well baby you can love up here on land
And what a difference it makes you will see
What a difference it makes to breathing
What a difference it makes it easy to love
The open air makes it easy so easy to love
The open air makes it easy easy to love
I swear the air is so much better up here then down there
Ohh the air makes it easy easy to love
You said your feeling ways that you never
Couldnt feel with all that pressure
Use to being dark at night and your kinda afraid to realize
That you still crack a smile cuz it makes you feel alive
And what a difference it makes you will see
What a difference it makes to breathing
What a difference it makes it easy to love
The open air makes it easy so easy to love
The open air makes it easy easy to love
I swear the air is so much better up here then down there
Ohh the air makes it easy easy to love
Baby I could show you the world
And the city thats inside of my heart baby
Dont know how you got a man in the first place
Just promise that you wont go back in again
Its better up here you know
Just tryin my best to show you
You started to feel like your floating higher and higher and im ever the one the man that makes
The open air makes it easy so easy to love
The open air makes it easy easy to love
I swear the air is so much better up here then down there
Ohh the air makes it easy easy to love
The open air makes it easy so easy to love
The open air makes it easy easy to love
I swear the air is so much better up here then down there
Ohh the air makes it easy easy to love
A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain in
Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but, boy, they bawl
When I'm thinkin' 'bout you (Ooh, no, no, no)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you (You know, know, know)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Do you think about me still? Do ya, do ya?
Or do you not think so far ahead? (Ahead)
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (Ooh, ooh)
Or do you not think so far ahead? (Ahead)
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (ooh, ooh)

Yes, of course
I remember, how could I forget?
How you feel?
And though you were my first time
A new feel
It won't ever get old, not in my soul
Not in my spirit, keep it alive
We'll go down this road
'Til it turns from color to black and white
Or do you not think so far ahead? (Ahead)
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (ooh, ooh)
Or do you not think so far ahead? (Ahead)
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (ooh, ooh)
Girl When I Met You
The Numbers Were Runnin' Through My Head
I Could've Wrote Down Your Number

And On The First Date Remember The Minutes Spent Together
You Called Me Rainman Then Kissed Me For Three Seconds Ooooh Aah (Aahh Aahh)

She woke me up to give me half
I can hear the children talk of ballin'
Like wildcats running on the grass, hey
You're a girl on this island
I'm a boy from America
My flight leaves tonight, but I don't think I'm going backwards
I won't be going backwards
[Hook]
You're my golden girl
You're the one I've chosen girl
You're 24k
You make it bright when it's grey
You're my golden girl
The sun has been kind to you
You're 24k (Girl)
But the sky's never grey (Never grey)
Silent moments, meditative poses
You break my focus, you make me laugh
Two mopeds racing through the forest
Making dirt clouds on a path, on a path
I'm my best on this island
I'm a mess in America
My flight left last night, but I know I'm not going back home, yeah
I'm not going back home, no
[Hook]
[If we build a ho](pending)use in paradise, will we get to heaven still?
If we don't have to live through hell just to get to heaven
I'mma stay right here with you
Til the hurricane comes, 'til the tsunami comes, I've found my girl
[Hook]
Um, you're my G-O L-D E-N G-I R-L
And that's for the females that can't spell, but
Thanks for fucking with me
You turn my dark into light, you're like a bucket of bleach
You see, I want you to know that
My negatives at home aren't working for my Kodak
So that means that I don't want to go back
Just know that I would like to stay here and hold that
Hand of yours, girl I'm a wreck in America
Your face is the best cause it's the same color as the lace on my neck
And you're golden, uh, your eyes open, fuck it
Let's toast and listen to Michael Bolton
I free-fall off the hill again
Let's see where I land, I'm like Gilligan
Um, I trust you, Golden, for what? ?
I'm just hopin' that you don't turn my neck green
I wanna see your pom poms from the stands
Come on, come on
My fingertips and my lips
They burn from the cigarettes
Forrest Gump you run my mind boy
Running on my mind boy
Forrest Gump
I know you Forrest
I know you wouldn't hurt a beetle
But you're so buff and so strong
I'm nervous Forrest
Forrest Gump
My fingertips and my lips
They burn from the cigarettes
Forrest Gump you run my mind boy
Running on my mind boy
Forrest Gump
I saw your game, Forrest
I was screaming run forty-four
But you kept running past the end zone
Oh where'd you go Forrest
Forrest Gump
And my fingertips and my lips
They burn from the cigarettes
Forrest Gump you run my mind boy
Running on my mind boy
Forrest Gump
Forest green
Forest blues
I'm remembering you
If this is love
I know it's true
I won't for-get you
It's for you Forrest
It's for you Forrest
If this is love
I know it's true
I won't
For-get-you
Darker times
Theyre telling boulder heavy lies
Looks like all weve got is each other
The truth is obsolete
Remember when all I had was my mother
She didnt compromise
She could recognize
Voodoo
Our daughters and our sons
Are just candles in the sun
Voodoo
Dont let him see divide
Dont you let her see divide
Voodoo
Shes got the whole wide world in her juicy fruit
Hes got the whole wide world in his pants
He wrapped the whole wide world in a wedding band
Then put the whole wide world on her hands
Shes got the whole wide world in her hands
Hes got the whole wide world in his hands
There's somethin' about you
I can't believe I'm even talking to you, tellin' me this right now
You're special
I wish you could see what I see
Golden rubbers in these denim pockets (denim pockets)
On my waist, there's a black Glock (black Glock)
New girl moved on the block (on the block)
She been plottin' on my brown cock (brown cock)
Last night I slept over hers (over hers)
During sex, I overheard (I overheard)
A sword sliced the air, I pulled out the na-na
Rolled off the bed then shot back, pa-pa
Blood on the sheets probably spillin' from my gash
Looked out the glass, seen you sprintin' on the grass
A real ninja with the blade and the mask
Got them gold ninja stars and red Supreme nunchuks
Now she tryna patch me up, but
Girl, I was just tryna get a nutbust
If that's your ex, you should probably own a pistol
But I'm guessin' it's wiser to exit with dude
The blinds wide open so he can
See you in the dark when you're sleepin'
Think about it, fresh out the shower
You touch yourself after hours
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom
You're sleeping alone in your bed
But check your window, he's at your window
The night light hits off, turnin' kisses to bites
I'm a down to earth nigga with intentions that's right
You'll be down in earth quicker if you diss me tonight
But I'll be the happiest if you decide to kick it tonight
We can chill and I can act like I don't wanna fuck
You can tell me all your problems like I really give one
But I give two for us 'cause you're the one that I want
Don't wanna seem like a punk pussy that sips on the punk pussy
See when I'm with my friends I just put on a front
But in the back of my top I'm writing songs about we
We as including I and yourself, making three
Little ones ? pretty hard if you ask me
You're a pretty broad in the top three
Of things that I've been waiting to come, so
Meet me by the lake around 10 and skinny dippin' and then
We can begin the pretend game, I wanna be Finn from Adventure in Time
The blinds wide open so he can
See you in the dark when you're sleepin'
Think about it, fresh out the shower
You touch yourself after hours
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom
You're sleeping alone in your bed
But check your window, he's at your window
One, two, you're the girl that I want
Three, four, five, six, seven, shit
Eight is the bullets if you say no after all this
And I just couldn't take it, you're so motherfuckin' gorgeous
Gorgeous, baby you're gorgeous
I just wanna drag you're lifeless body to the forest
And fornicate with it but that's because I'm in love with
You cunt
I just wanna talk, and conversate
Cause I usually just stalk you and masturbate
And I finally got the courage to ask you on a date
So just say yes, let the future fall into place
I just wanna talk, and conversate
Cause I usually just stalk you and masturbate
And I finally got the courage to ask you on a date
So just say yes, let the future fall into place cunt
The blinds wide open so he can

Gorgeous, baby you're gorgeous
We once had things in common
Now the only thing we share is the refrigerator
Ice cold, baby, I told you, I'm ice cold (ice cold!)
You out here flyin' high (high!)
Go head, fly that thing!
High! High!
But fly alone
You always smokin' in the house
What if my mother comes over?
You can't get up and get a job
Cause this little hustle's getting you by
You're the dealer and the stoner with the sweetest kiss I've ever known
{Chorus}
I know what I was on, I had a Pilot Jay
She took me high, then she took me home
Pilot Jay, Pilot Jay
Tonight she came stumblin' across my lawn again
I just don't know why I keep on tryin' to keep a grown woman sober
See there you go reachin' up your blouse and no I don't want a child
But I ain't been touched in a while by the dealer
And the stoner with the sweetest kiss I've ever known
{Chorus}
In the sky up above, the birds
I saw the sky like I never seen before
You thought I was above you
Above this in so many ways
Buf if I got a condo on a cloud
Then I guess you can stay at my place
I'mma get one
I need ya
I admit it
You're my Pilot Jay
Set the cheetahs on the loose
There's a thief out on the move
Underneath our legion's view
They have taken Cleopatra
Run run run, come back for my glory
Bring her back to me
Run run run, the crown of our pharaoh
The throne of our queen is empty
We'll run to the future, shining like diamonds
In a rocky world, rocky rocky world
Our skin like bronze and our hair like cashmere
As we march to rhythm on the palace floor
Chandeliers inside the pyramid, tremble from the force
Cymbals crash inside the pyramid, voices fill up the halls
Set the cheetahs on the loose
There's a thief out on the move
Underneath our legion's view
They have taken Cleopatra, Cleopatra
The jewel of Africa
What good is a jewel that ain't still precious?
How could you run off on me? How could you run off on us?
You feel like God inside that gold
I found you laying down with Samson and his full head of hair
Found my black queen Cleopatra, bad dreams, Cleopatra
Remove her, send the cheetahs to the tomb
Our war is over, our queen has met her doom
No more she lives no more serpent in her room
No more it has killed Cleopatra, Cleopatra
Big sun coming strong through the motel blinds
Wake up to your girl for now, let's call her Cleopatra
I watch you fix your hair
Then put your panties on in the mirror, Cleopatra
Then your lipstick, Cleopatra
Then your six-inch heels
Catch her
She's headed to the pyramid
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Pimping in my convos
Bubbles in my champagne
Let it be some jazz playing
Top floor motel suite twisting my cigars
Floor model TV with the VCR
Got rubies in my damn chain
Whip ain't got no gas tank
But it still got wood grain
Got your girl working for me
Hit the strip and my bills paid
That keep my bills paid
Hit the strip and my bills paid
Keep a nigga bills paid
She's working at the pyramid tonight
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
You showed up after work I'm bathing your body
Touch you in places only I know
You're wet and you're warm just like our bathwater
Can we make love before you go
The way you say my name makes me feel like
I'm that nigga
But I'm still unemployed
You say it's big but you take it
Ride cowgirl
But your love ain't free no more
But your love ain't free no more
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
I thought a thing like this gets better with time.
But I still need you.
Why is that?
You're the only image in my mind.
So I still see it. Around.
I miss you, like everyday.
Wanna be with you, but you're away.
I said I miss you, missing you insane.
If I got with you, could it feel the same.
Words don't ever seem to come up right.
But I still mean them.
Why is that?
It hurts my pride to tell you how I feel.
But I still need you.
Why is that?
It's cause I miss you, like everyday.
Wanna be with you, but you're away.
I said I miss you, missing you insane.
But if I got with you, could it feel the same.
It don't matter who you are, it is so simple.
A feeling, but it's everything.
No matter who you love, it is so simple
A feeling, but it's everything.
You don't know how little you matter
Until you're all alone
In the middle of Arkansas
With a little rock left in that glass dick
Used to date a blonde
You used to hit it raw
Cause she was and you are madly involved
Madly involved
Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You hit them stones and broke your home
Crack rock crack rock
Crack rock crack rock
Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You're hittin' stones and broke your home
Crack rock crack rock
Crack rock crack rock
You're shuckin' and jivin'
Stealin' and robbin'
To get the fixing that you're itching for
Your family stopped inviting you to things
Won't let you hold their infant
You used to get a little cut-up from time to time
But the freaks ain't trying to sleep with cracky
Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You hit them stones and you broke your home
Crack rock crack rock crack rock
Crooked cop dead cop
How much dope can you push to me
Crooked cop dead cop
No good for community
Fuckin' pig get shot
300 men will search for me
My brother get popped
And don't no one hear the sound
Don't no one hear the rounds, sound
Don't no one hear the shells, shells
Don't no one hear a sound
Don't no one disturb the peace for riot
Don't no one disrupt nirvana
Don't no one wanna blow the high
Crack rock
Crack rock
Crack rock
How you feeling girl
How's the gutter doing
Crack rock
Wiseman closed his mouth
Madman closed his fist
Young man shows his age
Judge man named it sin
Bad man don' exist, no
No evil man exists
Good man don't exist, no
No righteous man exists
Sad man cannot cry in place where man can see
Never witnessed father weep
This old man thought it weak
But strong man don't exist, no
No undying man exists
Weak man don't exist, no
Just flesh and blood exists
But your mother would be proud of you
I bet your mother would be proud of you
The beast will crawl this earth
Then fall in the dirt to feed the crows
They'll rip apart his flesh
Til all that's left is glorious bone
So you'll bury your own
Too vain
You saw it unfold
What you know
And you claimed all you could hold
Until death did you part from the mess you made
I bet your mother would be proud of you (x2)
Primate sharpens tool
To survive and thrive in the jungle
Maybe hearts were made to pump blood
Maybe lungs were made for flood
I won't blunt my blade for cut these chains
Rather let my limbs be drug through mud
You're my brother but your eyes are cold
You're my sister but your womb is bare
I bet our mother would be proud of you (x2)
Babe just say you miss me, is it that hard?
Too long since I've heard about our love
Am I in this by myself? (yeah, yeah)
With rose colored lenses on my store bought frames
To see something other than these blues and grays
I need something different (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
'Cause you ain't feeling the same
Who knows? Maybe I'm crazy
That's one big maybe
But even a fool knows when it's gold, gold, gold
I know pyrite from 24 karat
Cubics from genuine diamond (yeah)
A call from the woman who loves you
A "hello" from a friend
I know when it's real
I know how to tell
I know the difference between what you say and how you feel
Oh, oh
I know when it's real
Oh, I can tell the difference every time that you call
But I don't need a drink, I need some time in my car
Time to drive and think
Time to park and cry
You should've known you were beautiful
You should've known what I saw in ya
Please forgive me for feeling like it's all your fault
A heavy heart can't carry blame for the loss
Who knows? Maybe I'm crazy
That's one big maybe
But even a fool knows when it's gold, gold, gold
I know pyrite from 24 karat
Cubics from genuine diamond, yeah
A call from the woman who loves you
A "hello" from a friend
I know when it's real
I know how to tell
I know the difference between what you say and how you feel
Oh, oh
I know when it's real
You might not notice, but I'm a man with pride
And this hurts me baby
Deep down, deep down
And I can't let go of this
Gotta know I tried
It's pathetic, baby
Don't lie, don't lie
I'm a candle, you're the sun
And you're burning baby, you're burning baby
Burning up, burning up
Burning up, burning up
Burning up, yeah
Pyrite from 24 karat yeah
Cubics from genuine diamond yeah
A call from the woman who loves you
A "hello" from a friend
Never be more than friends
We'll never be...
A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain
In Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but, boy, they bawl
When I'm thinkin' 'bout you (ooh, no, no, no)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you (you know, know, know)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?
Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)
Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)
No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool
Enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kissed you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it, though
I'm lyin' down thinkin' 'bout you (ooh, no, no, no)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you (you know, know, know)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?
Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)
Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)
Yes, of course
I remember, how could I forget (how could I forget)?
How you feel (how you feel)?
You know you were my first time (time).
A new feel
It won't ever get old, not in my soul,
Not in my spirit, keep it alive (spirit, keep it alive)
We'll go down this road
'Til it turns from color to black and white
Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)
Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)
I wanna see your pom poms from the stands
Come on, come on
My fingertips, and my lips, they burn
From the cigarettes
Forrest Gump you run my mind boy
Running on my mind boy
Forrest Gump
I know you Forrest
I know you wouldn't hurt a beetle
But you're so buff, and so strong
I'm nervous Forrest
Forrest Gump
My fingertips, and my lips, they burn
From the cigarettes
Forrest Gump you run my mind boy
Running on my mind boy
Forrest Gump
I saw ya game, Forrest
I was screamin' run 44
But you kept runnin' past the end zone
Oh where'd you go Forrest
Forrest Gump
My fingertips, and my lips, they burn
From the cigarettes
Forrest Gump you run my mind boy
Running on my mind boy
Forrest Gump
Forrest green
Forrest blues
I remember you
This is love, I know it's true
I won't forget you (you)
(Oh you you) it's for you Forrest, you you
(Oh you you) it's you you Forrest
Forrest Gump
Turn a lamp on
Let me talk to you
See that light bulb, does something to you
Makes it a little harder to tell a lie dont it?
Make it difficult to run and hide dont it?
Tell the truth to me, good truth to me
Come close to me if thats you
I wanna see the details inside those beautiful eyes
The lies
(Bridge)
Myself aint never talked to me like that before (No)
I wonder what on earth hes searching for
(Chorus)
No wonder why theres no mirrors on these walls no more
You cant tell me why youre so terrified of beautiful
Scared of the good more than the evil
Scared of the light more than the dark
Scared of the truth so much more than the lie
I'm scared for you
I'm scared of you
Scared of beautiful
Just turn the lamp down
Dont talk to me
That light bulb, took something from me
Or gave something to me
I cant decide, I cant decide
Took freedom, gave purpose
Can't blend in, too perfect
All this beauty ever gave me was a reason for some beautiful thighs
(Bridge)
Myself aint never talked to me like that before (No)
I wonder what on earth hes searching for
(Chorus)
No wonder why theres no mirrors on these walls no more
You cant tell me why youre so terrified of beautiful
Scared of the good more than the evil
Scared of the light more than the dark
Scared of the truth so much more than the lie
I'm scared for you
I'm scared of you
Scared of beautiful
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who is the fairest of them all
Mirror, mirror oh youre so unfair to all of the beautiful ones
(Chorus)
No wonder why theres no mirrors on these walls no more
You cant tell me why youre so terrified of beautiful
Scared of the good more than the evil
Scared of the light more than the dark
Scared of the truth so much more than the lie
I'm scared for you
I'm scared of you
Scared of beautiful
The best song wasn't the single, but you weren't either
Livin' in Ladera Heights, the black Beverly Hills
Domesticated paradise, palm trees and pools
The water's blue, swallow the pill
Keepin' it surreal, whatever you like
Whatever feels good, whatever takes you mountain high
Keepin' it surreal, not sugar-free
My TV ain't HD, that's too real
Grapevine, mango, peaches, and limes, the sweet life
The sweet life, sweet life
Sweet life, sweet life
The sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet life
Sweet life, the sweet life
Sweetie pie
You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born
The sunshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach
The sweet life
The best song wasn't the single, but you couldn't turn your radio down
Satellite need a receiver, can't seem to turn the signal fully off
Transmitting the waves
You're catching that breeze 'til you're dead in the grave
But you're keepin' it surreal, whatever you like
Whatever feels good, whatever takes you mountain high
Keepin' it surreal, not sugar-free, my tv ain't HD, that's too real
Grapevines, mango, peaches, and lime, a sweet life
A sweet life
A sweet life, yeah
A sweet life, a sweet life
A sweet life
Live and die in the life
You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born, yeah
The sunshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach
And the water, is exactly what I wanted
It's everything I thought it would be (Thought it would be)
But this neighborhood is gettin' trippier every day
The neighborhood is goin' ape shit crazy
You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born
The star shine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach
The sweet life
I wanna see your pom poms from the stands
Come on, come on
My fingertips, and my lips, they burn
From the cigarettes
Forrest Gump you run my mind boy
Running on my mind boy
Forrest Gump
I know you Forrest
I know you wouldn't hurt a beetle
But you're so buff, and so strong
I'm nervous Forrest
Forrest Gump
My fingertips, and my lips, they burn
From the cigarettes
Forrest Gump you run my mind boy
Running on my mind boy
Forrest Gump
I saw ya game, Forrest
I was screamin' run 44
But you kept runnin' past the end zone
Oh where'd you go Forrest
Forrest Gump
My fingertips, and my lips, they burn
From the cigarettes
Forrest Gump you run my mind boy
Running on my mind boy
Forrest Gump

I remember you
This is love, I know it's true
I won't forget you (you)
(Oh you you) it's for you Forrest, you you
(Oh you you) it's you you Forrest
Forrest Gump
She singing bitch I'm paid, that's all I gotta say, I'm like who knew?
That after all the years I'd make a Weezy fan out of you too
When I met you, you were Thom Yorke, Chris Martin and U2
When you met me I was Three 6, Pimp C, Bun B, 8Ball and MJG, yeah
[Bridge:]
But we're both a long way from home
We got the windows down, the radio's on, always
[Verse 2:]
I wrote a letter to the sky saying maybe one day you'll get to kiss me
My girl found it in the car and said baby why you trying to diss me?
Cause you know you're my baby, you know you're my baby, ooh
I'm not just in it for the ride, in it for the ride, yeah
I believe Jehovah Jireh
I believe there's heaven, I believe in war
I believe a woman's temple
Gives her the right to choose but baby don't abort
I believe that marriage isn't
Between a man and woman but between love and love
And I believe you when you say that you've lost all faith
But you must believe in something, something, something
You gotta believe in something, something, something
I still believe in man
A wise one asked me why
Cause I just don't believe we're wicked
I know that we sin but I do believe we try
We all try, the girls try, the boys try
Women try, men try, you and I try, try, we all try
I don't believe in time travel
I don't believe our nation's flag is on the moon
I don't believe our lives are simple
And I don't believe they're short, this is interlude
I don't believe my hands are cleanly
Can't believe that you would let me touch your heart
She didn't believe me when I said that I lost my faith
You must believe in something, something, something
You gotta believe in something, something, something
I still believe in man
A wise one asked me why
Cause I just don't believe we're wicked
I know that we sin but I do believe we try
We all try, the girls try, the boys try
Women try, men try, you and I try, try, we all try
"Three minutes forty five seconds and counting,
We'll still go at this time"
Listening to Star Trek's star tracks
On the track to stars and back
Only after we get to the end
Passing planets feeling small
On the mattress floating off
How you breathing up here with nothing on, nothing on, baby girl
But you look good in your spacesuit
I can't keep my hands off you
Plus it's easy to love you
Oh, up here, up here
I'm a take it slow, slow
While the rockets burn, they burning
We'll be making love, baby
Rocket love, rocket love ooh
"Two minutes ten seconds and counting"
The candle's burning in the sun
We don't need them but you like them
They glow they glow, oh yeah
We were at the bar for quite a while
Took some time but we collided
Big Bang, Big Bang, look at what we made beautiful
You look good in your spacesuit
I can't keep my hands off you
Plus it's easy to love you
Oh, up here, up here
I'm a take it slow, slow
While the rockets burn, they burning
We'll be making love, baby
Rocket love, rocket love ooh
We can make believe that we're up there
But we're only in the backseat of this Eclipse ooh
If the lights go by, that means the cops flew by
But they won't bother us, no no no no
I'm a take it slow, slow
While the rockets burn, they burning
We'll be making love, baby
Rocket love, rocket love ooh
[x2]
"Twenty seconds and counting.
Fifteen seconds and counting.
Twelve, eleven, ten, nine, ignition sequence starts,
Six, five, four, three, two, one, zero.
All engines running. Liftoff! We have a liftoff!
The markings on your surface
Your speckled face
Flawed crystals hang from your ears
I couldn't gauge your fears
I can't relate to my peers
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather chip my pride than lose my mind out here
Maybe I'm a fool
Maybe I should move
And settle, two kids and a swimming pool
I'm not brave (brave)
I'm not brave
I'm living over city
And taking in the homeless sometimes
Been living in an idea
An idea from another man's mind
Maybe I'm a fool
To settle for a place with some nice views
Maybe I should move
Settle down, two kids and a swimming pool
I'm not brave
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather go to jail
I've tried hell
(It's a loop)
What would you recommend I do?
(And the other side of a loop is a loop)
This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
It's not what I'm like
It's just a fond farewell (brave)
Speaking of Nirvana, it was there
Rare as the feathers on my dash from a phoenix
There with my crooked teeth and companions sleeping, yeah
Dreaming a thought that could dream about a thought
That could think of the dreamer that thought
That could think of dreaming and getting a glimmer of God
I be dreaming a dream in a thought
That could dream about a thought
That could think about dreaming a dream
Where I can not, where I can not
Less morose and more present
Dwell on my gifts for a second
A moment one solar flare would consume, so I nod
Spin this flammable paper on the film that my life
High flights, inhale the vapor, exhale once and think twice
Eat some shrooms, maybe have a good cry, about you
See some colors, light hangglide off the moon
(In the dark, in the dark)
I'd do anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you, anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you, anything for
This is joy, this is summer
Keep alive, stay alive
Got your medal on, we're alone
Making sweet love, takin' time
"Look guys, Jacksons!"
That's a pretty fucking fast year flew by
That's a pretty long third gear in this car
Glidin' on the five
The deer run across, kill the headlights
Pretty fucking
Underneath moon light now
Pretty fucking
Sunrising, sand, comes a morning, haunting us with the beams
So it ain't as far as it used to be
It begins to blur, we get older (Blur!)
Summer's not as long as it used to be
Everyday counts like crazy (Smoke, hazy)
Wanna get soaked?
Wanna film a tape on the speed boat?
We smell of Californication, strike a pose
Everything grows in the Congo
Everything grows
Can you call when I call again?
On comes the evening
Both seeking ends
Peace in my hands worth twice than a friend
And two limbs over shoulder, carry the way
Because I'm stronger, congo is damned (smoke)
In comes the morning (smoke)
In comes the morning (haze)
[Verse 1]
My hands fatigued and off the opus
Kept it underground, I focus
I feel afterlife, 6 under oath, don't want no hokus pokus
Niggas tryna go pop, I draw contact
With my facemask
Nothin' but, nothin' but net
Is you Roger or Novak?
You still are no match, you get no rematch
Boy, you missed your moment
Perusing the MoMA
I'm all on my lonely, burst in tears
On his shoulder and it's so cold cause he sculptured
Where's the shaman ayahuasca
I at once ask him for atonement
I never ever trust a pre-rolled
I never let a random mothafucka shoot the B-roll
I never ask advice from him cause what could he know?
Never fuck someone you wouldn't wanna be though
It forever seems like time's up
When we swerve in the Honda
Now forever seems like no time, I mean time flies when you have some
Both nuts weigh two pounds, all on your bitch like futons
My crew saved you crew like niggas came through with the groupons
Cookin' with the grease down, couple fries and Cholula
Are you slowin' down? Are you holdin' down?
Whoever held you down
Whoever propped you up
Built the structures with you
Swished the buckets with ya
Who was fuckin' with ya?
Really brothers when you needed that?
When you seeing eye is a forced black
Hail Mary on a fourth down
Hands to the sky
[Verse 2]
Yeah, peace to the holy, peace to the people that think they know me
Peace to Moschino, cover your ass, your rectum showing
Peace to the boys that we used to be though
Geto Boy North Face too cold on these hoes
Peace out to Willy B, Bushwick Billy and Face
Piece of steak grillin' in Jesus' name, speakin' his grace
Hands to the sky
[Verse 3]
U-N-I-T-Y
Neptunes and peace signs
Chiraq, Palestine life
Hyper built 1995
You'd think that was airstrikes on outside
I put refugees in my villa
Play kids the Fu-Gee-La
All this space Atlanta
Place order McMansion and two apple pies
I want the Porsche, a Bugatti design
Silicon Valley, new venture is tits up
How do I crop your new bitch out my Vine?
Sick, blew nose, spit foamin' white like frapple, Jackal
El Chapo, defacto
Belle nacho, shell taco, crunch crackle
Green emerald
Pink diamonds like Apple Jack bull
How come the ecstasy always depresses me so?
How come the ecstasy always depresses me so?
How come the ecstasy always depresses me so?
How come the ecstasy always depresses me so?
How come the ecstasy always depresses me so?
How come the ecstasy always depresses me so?
How come the ecstasy always depresses me so?
In a certain way
Cause you are beautiful and young
You deserve to have the best in life
In a certain way
Hand me a towel I'm dirty dancing by myself
Gone off tabs of that acid
Form me a circle, watch my jagger
Might lose my jacket and hit a solo
One time
We too loud in public then police turned down the function
Now we outside and the timing's perfect
Forgot to tell you, gotta tell you how much I vibe with you
And we don't gotta be solo
Now stay away from highways
My eyes like them red lights
Right now I prefer yellow
Red-bone, so mellow
Fuck 'round, be cutting you
Think we were better off solo
I got that act right in the Windy city that night
No trees to blow through
But blow me and I owe you
Two grams when the sunrise
Smoking good, rolling solo
Solo, solo
Solo, solo
S-solo, solo
S-solo, solo
It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Solo, solo
Solo, solo
I'm skipping showers and switching socks, sleeping good and long
Bones feeling dense as fuck, wish a nigga would cross
And catch a solo, on time
White leaf on my boxers, green leaf turn to vapors for the low
And that mean cheap, cause ain't shit free and I know it
Even love ain't, cause it's enough cost, that clinic kill my soul
But you gotta hit the pussy raw though
Now your baby momma ain't so vicious, all she want is her Pickett fence
And you protest and you picket sign, but them courts won't side with you
Won't let you fly solo
I wanted that act right in Colorado that night
I brought trees to blow through, but it's just me and no you
Stayed up 'til my phone died, smoking big, rolling solo
It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Solo, solo
Solo, solo
By myself
Solo, solo
Solo, solo
This is joy, this is summer
Keep alive, stay alive
Got your medal on, we're alone
Making sweet love, takin' time
"Look guys, Jacksons!"
That's a pretty fucking fast year flew by
That's a pretty long third gear in this car
Glidin' on the five
The deer run across, kill the headlights
Pretty fucking
Underneath moon light now
Pretty fucking
Sunrising, sand, comes a morning, haunting us with the beams
So it ain't as far as it used to be
It begins to blur, we get older (Blur!)
Summer's not as long as it used to be
Everyday counts like crazy (Smoke, hazy)
Wanna get soaked?
Wanna film a tape on the speed boat?
We smell of Californication, strike a pose
Everything grows in the Congo
Everything grows
Can you call when I call again?
On comes the evening
Both seeking ends
Peace in my hands worth twice than a friend
And two limbs over shoulder, carry the way
Because I'm stronger, congo is damned (smoke)
In comes the morning (smoke)
In comes the morning (haze)
Oh, where the trees burn down
Place where the fields went down in flames
You could put a hole in the ground
Oh, seasons dance for rain
It takes a mind to wander
Conscience to feel ashamed
There's no place to hide out here
These skies are filled with pain
And both our hands are filthy
Pointing up at the moon
Girl tonight I hold you close, close enough to prove
Hope a garden grows where we dance this afternoon
Hope our children walk by spring and flowers bloom
Hope they'll get to see my color
Know that I've enjoyed sunshine
Pray they'll get to see me, me wither (flowers)See me wither
Oh and I hope
Know that I've enjoyed the sunshine
(You know it happens all...)
Know that I've enjoyed the sunshine ...
Know it happens all...all the time
Be, be, be
You know it happens all....all the time
All the time
Be, be, be
I'm gone
Be, be, be, be
[Intro]
I've been running all year
I wish God [?]
I can't see, so cloudy
Sometimes it rain
You still behind like asses
You ain't got no words for [?]
Wrong side of average
[Chorus]
And when you slide on me, you slide on me
You slide off [?] side, yeah-yeah
Cause a freak slide on me
First time's on me
Next time gon' be oh, yeah-yeah
[Verse 1]
For your mentality
You play ball, you run 5 on 5 at least 3 times a week
Live parked down the street
Waitin' on you to tie every time with Victor key
Play so savagely
Always fighting with them you grew up with
When you lose you don't cry but you lowkey sad to see
If we cut like some champions you'll redeem yourself
You'll sleep happily, uh-haha, smiling
I'm still working while your dream pop
I can never let a scene stop stylin' on me
I don't think they get the point pop
They forgettin' that it's me
Akhi tell 'em I ain't goin', wallahi
I'm just all day running numbers
How the fuck you think I live?
Too many hands waitin' for my downfall
They're like somethings gotta give
Boys in the hood'll give me updates like they know the weather
If you ain't in the streets you can't see the sky in my hair
I can see the sky
[Chorus]
And when you slide on me, you slide on me
You slide on both sides, yeah-yeah
And when you slide on me, you slide on me
Both sides on me, oh, yeah-yeah
[Outro]
This is for when you change your mind and slide back this way
You'll be being yourself
I can never let a see stop stylin' on me
This is for the night set backs won't let that much fade
Guess you can't blame no one you choose blah-blah
Blah, blah, blah, blah
Blah, blah, blah, blah
Things I pain worthless
Now
To the edge I'll race you
To the end I'll make it
All the risk, I'll take it
Head bang with my four friends
We pour taste out for the dead
This is the blood, the body, the life right now
The hype right now
Might be what I need
Might be what I need
Said you want to hold me now
You can't end me now
That might be what you need
(This side)
You wanna keep me now
(This side)
Don't let me down
(I'm on this side, I'm on this side, I'm on this side)
(Fathers of the Earth be kind)
(To the fathers of whom we rely
(Fathers of Earth be kind)
(To the mothers of whom we rely)
(Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
We know your sucker
Pretty sweet-eeet
He came up in Dallas
Had no hazel in his eyes
Had them sailors on his thighs when these ladies show him
Kept it faded on the side, he was seeing someone
He was dating on the side, he was seeing double
I was spending hula
We was spending so much time
It was getting cooler
All this drillin' got the dick feeling like a power tool
Feel it movin'
Nigga out his mama house now, that's a power move
That's what I gotta do, for real
Shine for real
Shine for real
Feelings come, feelings go
Feelings come, feelings go
Feelings come, feelings go
Feelings come, feelings go
Comme des GarÃ§ons, Comme des GarÃ§ons, Comme des
Comme des GarÃ§ons, Comme des GarÃ§ons, Comme des
Comme des GarÃ§ons, Comme des GarÃ§ons, Comme des GarÃ§ons
Comme des GarÃ§ons, Comme des GarÃ§ons, Comme des
I will always love you how I do
Let go of a prayer for ya
Just a sweet word
The table is prepared for you
(Ball so hard, boys for sex)
(Ball so hard, boys for sex)
(Ball so hard, boys for sex)
(Ball so hard, boys for sex)
Wishing you Godspeed, glory
There will be mountains you won't move
(Oh-oh-oh)
Still I'll always be there for you
(Oh-oh-oh)
How I do
I let go of my claim on you, it's a free world
You look down on where you came from sometimes
But you'll have this place to call home, always
(This love will keep us still blinded of the eyes, silence in the ears, darkness of the mind)
Until the time
(This love will keep us still blinded of the eyes, silence in the ears, darkness of the mind)
(This love will keep us still blinded of the eyes, silence in the ears, darkness of the mind)
'Till the time we die
Oh-oh, ohhh
I'll always love you
Until the time we die
Oh-oh, ohhh
[Intro: Frank Ocean]
Turn the mountain view, find a place for a quiet one
Suburbia got a yard
All this estate for my mind to run
Run
[Chorus: Jazmine Sullivan & Frank Ocean]
I know you're in there somewhere
Can't wait some, something you
Someone out there
Trying to love the one you're with tonight
Try to love the one you're with
Late at night sometimes at home
You don't have to be all by yourself
In the morning light
This'll all be over with
I know you're in there somewhere
Can't outrun something you need
It's been so long[Outro]
Feel what I'm sayin'? (Yeah) Like 10, 10, 12, 11, 10, 6, aight? Platinum
Hand me a towel I'm dirty dancing by myself
Gone off tabs of that acid
Form me a circle, watch my jagger
Might lose my jacket and hit a solo
One time
We too loud in public then police turned down the function
Now we outside and the timing's perfect
Forgot to tell you, gotta tell you how much I vibe with you
And we don't gotta be solo
Now stay away from highways
My eyes like them red lights
Right now I prefer yellow
Red-bone, so mellow
Fuck 'round, be cutting you
Think we were better off solo
I got that act right in the Windy city that night
No trees to blow through
But blow me and I owe you
Two grams when the sunrise
Smoking good, rolling solo
Solo, solo
Solo, solo
S-solo, solo
S-solo, solo
It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Solo, solo
Solo, solo
I'm skipping showers and switching socks, sleeping good and long
Bones feeling dense as fuck, wish a nigga would cross
And catch a solo, on time
White leaf on my boxers, green leaf turn to vapors for the low
And that mean cheap, cause ain't shit free and I know it
Even love ain't, cause it's enough cost, that clinic kill my soul
But you gotta hit the pussy raw though
Now your baby momma ain't so vicious, all she want is her Pickett fence
And you protest and you picket sign, but them courts won't side with you
Won't let you fly solo
I wanted that act right in Colorado that night
I brought trees to blow through, but it's just me and no you
Stayed up 'til my phone died, smoking big, rolling solo
It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Solo, solo
Solo, solo
By myself
Solo, solo
Solo, solo
I will always love you how I do
Let go of a prayer for ya
Just a sweet word
The table is prepared for you
(Ball so hard, boys for sex)
(Ball so hard, boys for sex)
(Ball so hard, boys for sex)
(Ball so hard, boys for sex)
Wishing you Godspeed, glory
There will be mountains you won't move
(Oh-oh-oh)
Still I'll always be there for you
(Oh-oh-oh)

But you'll have this place to call home, always

'Till the time we die
Oh-oh, ohhh
I'll always love you
Until the time we die
Oh-oh, ohhh
If I was being honest
I'd say long as I could fuck three times a day and not skip a meal I'm good
I used to work on my feet for 7 dollars a hour
Call my momma like momma
I ain't making minimum wage momma
I'm on momma
I'm on
Now I'm making 400, 600, 800k momma
To stand on my feet momma
Play these songs, it's therapy momma, they paying me momma
I should be paying them
I should be paying y'all honest to God
I'm just a guy I'm not a god
Sometimes I feel like I'm a god but I'm not a god
If I was I don't know which heaven would have me momma
Let me run this bitch
I'ma run it into the ground momma, the whole galaxy
God damn, fuck these lames, they don't want none
Fuck these lames, they don't want none
Fuck these niggas
Fuck these niggas, they don't want none
Fuck these niggas
Fuck you niggas
Fuck me if I hated on you
I'ma stick around
I'm gon' let my nuts hang
Nigga you got some just like me don't you?
Or maybe not just like me
You know I'm Africano Americano
And even if you're half Japanese
Roots run deep
Family tree, throw a big shadow, tech company
Please gimme immortality
I'm going rapidly
Fading drastically
Or pulled the zip down
Wet your lips first
Lick the tip now
Smoke some'n
They tryna find 2Pac
Don't let 'em find 2Pac
He evade the press
He escape the stress
La da da da da
La da da da da
La da da da da
I'll keep quiet and let you run your phone bill up
I know you love to talk
I ain't on your schedule
I ain't on no schedule
I ain't had me a job since 2009
I ain't on no sales floor
You say I'm changing on you
I feel like Selena
They wanna murder a nigga
Murder me like Selena
You must ain't get the memo
I don't cut bitches no more
But your bitch my exception
Come get her outta my four door

Remember when I had that Lexus no
Our friendship don't go back that far
Tyler slept on my sofa yeah
Niggas go back that far
I ain't smoked all year
This the last song so
I'm finna wipe that off
Tolerance is so low, still smoke a whole 'gar
Menage on my birthday
Tap out on the first stroke
'Cause this ain't no work day
She don't give head anyway
'Cause what niggas say
That's what she tell her man
What a difference distance makes
Niggas want fight in the streets now
Shit starting to make my hands hurt
Jay hit me on the email
Said I oughta act my net worth
Dog this is chess now
Not fetch I ain't runnin for a nigga
Ain't ran since track meet
That's the only time I ran from a nigga
You could change this track now
Could've changed this bitch a long time ago

Ever, ever thought about trying
How far is a light year?
How far is a light year?
Yup, duplex in New Orleans east
I was writing out everything, don't tell nobody
Some things I didn't even tell me
Sleeping on my back, my body would wake up after me
My brother fresh out the penitentiary
The alcohol was stinging me
My four cousins stayed with me, stayed with us
Mom was in the shower, my aunt came over to fuss
So she get out in cut offs and a wife beater
Bare feet, braless, titties swinging, she was seventeen and
(In Reebok classics)
(Take the bully on after classes)
Her name was (?) we was cool after
(?) in Air Maxes
Fucked behind with road rashes
Lost the virgin on an air mattress
Tension rising, feeling unnatural
It's what I will do just to show you
That it's special now
What could I do to know you better than I do now?
What can I do to love you more than I do now?
What can I do to know you better?
What can I do to show my love?
What can I do to know you better?
What can I do? What can I do?
Oh, minha honey baby! Woo!
[Frank]
I was just telling that I got this girl before
And I was together since 3 years
And em, I was not even cheating on her or what
And Facebook arrived and she wanted me to accept her on Facebook
And I don't want it because I was like in front of her
And she told me like "Accept me on Facebook"
It was virtual, made no sense
So I say "I'm in front of you, I don't need to accept you on Facebook"
She started to be crazy
She thoughts that because I didn't accept her
She thought I was cheating
She told me like, uh, it's over
And I can't believe it
It is crazy because I like her
I'm in front of you, I'm every day
Here in your house
That's like jealousy
Pure jealousy for nothing
You know
Virtual thing
I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me
The start of nothing
I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
The start of nothing
I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good
If I could see through walls, I could see you're faking
If you could see my thoughts you would see our faces
Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
We didn't give a fuck back then
I ain't a kid no more
We'll never be those kids again
We'd drive to Syd's, had the X6 back then
Back then
No matter what I did
My waves wouldn't dip back then
Everything sucked back then
We were friends
I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me
The start of nothing
I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
The start of nothing
I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good
In the halls of your hotel
Arm around my shoulder so I could tell
How much I meant to meant it sincere back then
We had time to kill back then
You ain't a kid no more
We'll never be those kids again
It's not the same, ivory's illegal
Don't you remember?
I broke your heart last week
You'll probably feel better by the weekend
Still remember, had you going crazy
Scream my name
The feeling deep down is good
I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me
The start of nothing
I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
And we started from nothing
I could hate you now
It's alright to hate me now
When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good
All the things I didn't mean to say
I didn't mean to do
There were things you didn't need to say
You didn't need to need to
I could dream all night
Dream all night
I could drive all night
Drive all night
Dreaming, dream on
These bitches want Nikes
They looking for a check
Tell em it ain't likely
Said she need a ring like Carmelo
Must be on that white like Othello
All you want is Nikes
But the real ones just like you
Just like me
I don't play, I don't make time
But if you need dick I got you and I yam from the line
Pour up for A$AP
RIP Pimp C
RIP Trayvon, that nigga look just like me
Woo, fuckin' buzzin', woo!
That my little cousin, he got a little trade
His girl keep the scales, a little mermaid
We out by the pool, some little mermaids
Me and them gel
Like twigs with them bangs
Now that's a real mermaid
You been holding your breath
Weighted down
Punk madre, punk papa
He don't care for me
But he cares for me
And that's good enough
We don't talk much or nothin'
But when we talkin' about something
We have good discussion
I met his friends last week, feels like they're up to something
That's good for us
We'll let you guys prophesy
We'll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first
We'll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first
Living so the last night feels like a past life
Speaking of the, don't know what got into people
Devil be possessin homies
Demons try to body jump
Why you think I'm in this bitch wearing a fucking Yarmulke
Acid on me like the rain
Weed crumbles in the glitter
Rain, glitter
We laid out on this wet floor
Away turf, no Astro
Mesmerized how the strobes glow
Look at all the people feet dance
I know that your nigga came with you
But he ain't with you
We only human and it's humid in these Balmains
I mean my balls sticking in my jeans
We breathin pheremones, Amber Rose
Sippin' pink-gold lemonades
Feelin'
I may be younger but I'll look after you
We're not in love, but I'll make love to you
When you're not here I'll save some for you
I'm not him but I'll mean something to you
I'll mean something to you
I'll mean something to you
You got a roommate he'll hear what we do
It's only awkward if you're fucking him too
[Intro]
Lobster
[Verse]
I was in all 'em, I was in it
10K talkin mid-Stros
Prime prime time on my life with ya
Puttin' prime numbers up though
On em 777 flights with ya
Take a shower with it gotta cleanse it
Keep the safety off in it
And we finna have a minute
Outta wedlock I forgive it
And forget it
Cause only God can forget it
All this hotel livin'
Might as well pay the mortgage
What else billing
Sucked a dick long had a swan neck
Put some real swans in the pond then
Fell asleep in the foreign
After the free show at the Garden
Let the LED row deal on em
Be the stage watchin from the audience
Let me sell the bigger sock next week
On me on my badness
[Outro]
When I'm up they gon' hate
When I'm sideways, yeah, I set me straight
When I'm up they gon' hate
When I'm down they gon' celebrate
Sittin' sideways, sideways, nah, it's not too late
(Oohhhhhhh, ohhhhhhh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I will be honest, I wasn't devastated
But you could've held my hand through this, baby
In my mind, I didn't need
Warned your ex
I run my hands through what's left
But we're getting older, baby
How much longer baby?
Why am I preaching?
To this choir, to the saved kids
Just like mine versions of these belong to you
After a while
They're keeping me close to you
(Just like me, they long to be
Close to you)
Are you with me?
Are you with me?
Are you with me?
That ain't really loud, couldn't raise his voice
'Cause the wave gone
Niggas sound like Reggie
(Already, you all ready)
(Niggas goin' in, fuck it)
Pray to the pipe, (fuck it) I slide deep inside
Not too deep, not too shallow, I might, full at sight
She shock full of my swipe, like a capsule so tight
With that substance you need, start a family tonight
Big body murk, LED lights and it's all overpriced
The dollar been cheap than a bitch
Tuberose and two lips
On the boxes you ripped
From the holes in your skin
Hit the road and get rich
Or stay home and get broke
It's your choice in the end
Yeah they watching my fence
Like they next to my kin
Like they paid by the Pope
Got some priests by the door
Frisk the dealers before they step into my glow
Oh my my
Get it, get it
It's a good guy, he hooked it up
Said if I was in NY I should look you up
I, first time I done saw you
You text nothing like you look
Here's to the gay bar you took me to
It's when I realized you talk too much, more than I do
I, it's highlights when I was convinced
That it isn't much more it's so not you
I know you don't need me right now
And to you it's just a late night out
This nigga, all the bitches in the neighborhood wanna fuck you nigga
He told me
I used to fuck with all of 'em
Yeah I ain't got bitches no more
But now I don't care about bitches like that my nigga
That shit Jasmine fucking wrecked my heart
I don't even know how to even feel about it
Pool side convo about your summer last night, oh yeah
About your summer last night
Ain't give you no play, mm
Could I make it shine last night?
Could I make it shine, on it last night?
Could we make it in? Do we have time?
I'll be the boyfriend in your wet dreams tonight
Noses on a rare, little virgin wears the white
You cut your hair but you used to live a blinded life
Wish I was there, wish we had grown up on the same advice
And our time was right
Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
It's nothing, it's nothing
Keep a place for me, for me
Now and then you miss it, sounds make you cry
Some nights you dance with tears in your eyes
I came to visit cause you see me like a UFO
That's like never cause I made you use your self control
And you made me lose my self control, my self control
Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
Keep a place for me
It's nothing, it's nothing
It's nothing, it's nothing
I, I, I
Know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summer time
Give up, just tonight, night, night
I, I, I
Know you got someone comin'
You're spitting game, oh you got it
I, I, I
Know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summer time
Give up, just tonight, night, night
I, I, I
Know you got someone comin'
You're spitting game, oh you got it
(Nobody else, nobody else)
I, I, I
Know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summer time
Give up, just tonight, night, night
I, I, I
Know you got someone comin'
You're spitting game, oh you got it

Bones feeling dense as fuck, wish a nigga would cross

White leaf on my boxers, green leaf turn to vapors for the low
And that mean cheap, cause ain't shit free and I know it
Even love ain't, cause it's enough cost, that clinic kill my soul
But you gotta hit the pussy raw though
Now your baby momma ain't so vicious, all she want is her Pickett fence
And you protest and you picket sign, but them courts won't side with you
Won't let you fly solo
I wanted that act right in Colorado that night
I brought trees to blow through, but it's just me and no you
Stayed up 'til my phone died, smoking big, rolling solo
It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Solo, solo
Solo, solo
By myself
Solo, solo
Solo, solo
Bad luck to talk on these rides
Mind on the road
Your dilated eyes watch the clouds float
White Ferrari
Had a good time
16: how was I supposed to know anything?
I let you out at Central
I didn't care to state the plain
Kept my mouth closed
We're both so familiar
White Ferrari
Close by me
You will find
You will find me
Is this the slow body
Left when I forgot to speak
So I text to speech, lesser speeds
Texas speed, yes
Based takes it's toll on me
Eventually, eventually, yes
I only eventually, eventually, yes
I care for you still and I will forever
That was my part of the deal, honest
We got so familiar
Spending each day of the year, White Ferrari
Good times
In this life, life
One too many years
So taste what I lived on a facelift
Mind over matter is magic
I do magic
If you think about it it's over in no time the best life
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm sure we're taller in another dimension
You say we're smaller and not worth the mention
You're tired of movin', your body's achin'
We could vacay, there's places to go
Clearly this isn't all that there is
Can't take what's been given
But we're so okay here, we're doing fine
I'm up and naked
You dream of walls that hold us in prison
It's just a scar, at least that's what they call it
And we're free to fall
These bitches want Nikes
They looking for a check
Tell em it ain't likely
Said she need a ring like Carmelo
Must be on that white like Othello
All you want is Nikes
But the real ones just like you
Just like me
I don't play, I don't make time
But if you need dick I got you and I yam from the line
Pour up for A$AP
RIP Pimp C
RIP Trayvon, that nigga look just like me
Woo, fuckin' buzzin', woo!
That my little cousin, he got a little trade
His girl keep the scales, a little mermaid
We out by the pool, some little mermaids
Me and them gel
Like twigs with them bangs
Now that's a real mermaid
You been holding your breath
Weighted down
Punk madre, punk papa
He don't care for me
But he cares for me
And that's good enough
We don't talk much or nothin'
But when we talkin' about something
We have good discussion
I met his friends last week, feels like they're up to something
That's good for us
We'll let you guys prophesy
We'll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first
We'll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first
Living so the last night feels like a past life
Speaking of the, don't know what got into people
Devil be possessin homies
Demons try to body jump
Why you think I'm in this bitch wearing a fucking Yarmulke
Acid on me like the rain
Weed crumbles in the glitter
Rain, glitter
We laid out on this wet floor
Away turf, no Astro
Mesmerized how the strobes glow
Look at all the people feet dance
I know that your nigga came with you
But he ain't with you
We only human and it's humid in these Balmains
I mean my balls sticking in my jeans
We breathin pheremones, Amber Rose
Sippin' pink-gold lemonades
Feelin'
I may be younger but I'll look after you
We're not in love, but I'll make love to you
When you're not here I'll save some for you
I'm not him but I'll mean something to you
I'll mean something to you
I'll mean something to you
You got a roommate he'll hear what we do
It's only awkward if you're fucking him too
[Verse]
This is a death wish, the days of hopeless
Leave myself at the wraths of you
At the mercy, of you
And I be needing my sleep
Need to catch you
At the mercy of you
[Breakdown]
You
At the, at the, at the
At the, yeah, at the
At the, at the the

With this Apple appliance, you can capture live videos
Still motion pictures shot at high frequency
Blurring, blurring the line
[Chorus]
With this Apple appliance, you can capture live videos
Still motion pictures shot at high frequency
Blurring, blurring the line between still and motion
With this Apple device
You can blur the border between still and motion pictures
You can blur the border between still and motion pictures
[Verse]
With this Sony Telephone 4K video is in your palm
It is in your palm, in your palm
In your hand, in your hand
With your eyes, with your eyes
You can capture real 4K
With this Samsung telephone, we don't call it telephone
I think I saw billboards describing life interactivity
Life sharing, live posting, streaming off your videos
The new Samsung Galaxy allows you to livestream your life
Livestream your life, livestream your life
You can blur the border between still and motion pictures
You can still stream you life
Your life can be streamed
In endless communication
We all show interest in every body's life
Your life can be streamed
Life, your life can be streamed
Life, life
[Chorus]
You can blur the border between still and motion pictures
You can blur the border between still and motion pictures
You can blur the border between still and motion pictures
You can blur the border
With this device, the border between still and motion pictures is absolutely blurred
Many college students have gone to college
And gotten hooked on drugs, marijuana, and alcohol
Listen, stop trying to be somebody else
Don't try to be someone else
Be yourself and know that that's good enough
Don't try to be someone else
Don't try to be like someone else
Don't try to act like someone else, be yourself
Be secure with yourself
Rely and trust upon your own decisions
On your own beliefs
You understand the things that I've taught you
Not to drink alcohol, not to use drugs
Don't use that cocaine or marijuana because that stuff is highly addictive
When people become weed-heads they become sluggish, lazy, stupid and unconcerned
Sluggish, lazy, stupid and unconcerned
That's all marijuana does to you, okay? This is mom
Unless you're taking it under doctor's umm control
Then it's regulated. Do not smoke marijuana, do not consume alcohol
Do not get in the car with someone who is inebriated
This is mom, call me, bye
Gonna be somebody, oh I follow
Running showers and the mist so fly
Enough time to know, know nothing at all
I see the lines, there's two lines
You'll live a life anew
Tell me what you need from me? Gas money?
And I did what I needed to, to be guided
Cut your teeth on sheets in Paris
Hope the water's deep enough
(Rushes to the head)
We've been here before
The first time is not the best time
I ain't felt this way in years
First I was rushing full weight
This time I'm waiting for a rush
(Help me up)
Infatuation's your rush
(Help me up, help me, help me up, help me up yeah, do you)
Keep pushing on 'em, never let 'em stop
All what happens to be, what happens to me, upon his feet
Twin peaking, highs and lows, we shaded off alone
Bygones we wasted here, riding in my two wheels
I love the way you make me feel
(What happens to me)
Me, you and, you and me
(Yeah, just you and me)
([?] are up on my feet)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I be on [?]
I'll wake up in a week
Wake me up in a week
It don't matter
It don't matter [?] pipe it down
It was a crowd, quieting down
I won't sit still, I won't sit still
Friday, gone too late
It's going against your head
I'm getting used to it
Yeah you're going to get used to it
I love the way you make me feel
Saturdays involved making our entrances into life outside
We've been in this room too long
Recreation is keeping us self contained and aware
Of each other's form
Still and in full strides just the same
Keeping us warm
Walking in straight lines
Talking in sleep at night
Coddled and pacified
Virgins of mothers
Son who leave
The son who leave
Having you around
Son who leave
The son who leave
Having you around is
What if we decide to live by choice
All this time I knew
That average was something to fall back on
After genius ends
I watch video only difference is it's flat and (?)
Behind wet faces
Slip my pants back on
And rewind it back one more
The tape stopped before I was back alone
I'll be back before
The streets lights on, before the daylight's gone
I was spoiled by lavish thoughts
They don't compare, no not at all
And had this been the best I might not know
What to do with us
Or we're too sure
We're to give my words can't hold
The backs of God
We're so sorry
Least we did us perfect
Perfect, perfect
Love, love, love
Perfect, perfect
If you live by (never)
Love
And you're on (?)
Somtimes it's hard to tell you so
Oh may not be (?)
You know
There was hearts
Loved ones
Oh, keep self from me
When I'm orchestrate
I'm just a (?)
Of what I see
What don't you best our love
You're the positive one
Feeling something
If you goin' in
Oh yeah
Oh in you
Gone
Oh when you often
Goin' in
Goin' in
Goin' in
[Instrumental by Frank Ocean, Joe Thornally & Troy NÅKA]
It's a good guy, he hooked it up
Said if I was in NY I should look you up
I, first time I done saw you
You text nothing like you look
Here's to the gay bar you took me to
It's when I realized you talk too much, more than I do
I, it's highlights when I was convinced
That it isn't much more it's so not you
I know you don't need me right now
And to you it's just a late night out
This nigga, all the bitches in the neighborhood wanna fuck you nigga
He told me
I used to fuck with all of 'em
Yeah I ain't got bitches no more
But now I don't care about bitches like that my nigga
That shit Jasmine fucking wrecked my heart
I don't even know how to even feel about it
I will always love you how I do
Let go of a prayer for ya
Just a sweet word
The table is prepared for you
(Ball so hard, boys for sex)
(Ball so hard, boys for sex)
(Ball so hard, boys for sex)
(Ball so hard, boys for sex)
Wishing you Godspeed, glory
There will be mountains you won't move
(Oh-oh-oh)
Still I'll always be there for you
(Oh-oh-oh)
How I do
I let go of my claim on you, it's a free world
You look down on where you came from sometimes
But you'll have this place to call home, always
(This love will keep us still blinded of the eyes, silence in the ears, darkness of the mind)
Until the time
(This love will keep us still blinded of the eyes, silence in the ears, darkness of the mind)
(This love will keep us still blinded of the eyes, silence in the ears, darkness of the mind)
'Till the time we die
Oh-oh, ohhh
I'll always love you
Until the time we die
Oh-oh, ohhh
Yeah, yeah oh
Yeah, yeah yeah
That's the way everyday goes
Every time we have no control
If the sky is pink and white
If the ground is black and yellow
It's the same way you showed me
Nod my head, don't close my eyes
Half way on a slow move
It's the same way you showed me
If you could fly then you'd feel south
Up north's getting cold soon
The way it is, we're on land
So I'm someone to hold true
Keep you cool in this good life
Won't let you down when it's all ruined
Just the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Good Glory, dear
It's all downhill from here
In the wake of a hurricane
Dark skin of a summer shade
Nose dive in the flood lines
Tall tower, milk crate
It's the same way you showed me
Cannon ball off the porch side
Older kids trying off the roof
Just the same way you showed me (you showed)
If you could die and come back to life
Up for air from the swimming pool
You kneel down to the dry land
Kiss the Earth that birthed you
Gave you tools just to stay alive
And make it up when the sun is ruined
That's the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Where God could fear
It's all downhill from here
What a life
Remember how it was
Climb trees, Michael Jackson, all in this year
Say what up to Magic, just shoot
Say what up to Penny
Say what up to life one more time
And I know what you might want to know
Run from me and your team
Still ain't grabbin six (take it easy)
Give me somethin sweet
Bitch I might bite, ain't no tellin
This is life, life immortality
Round the city
Round the clock
Everybody needs you
No you can't make everybody equal
Although you got beaucoup family
You don't even got nobody being honest with you
Breath till I evaporated
My whole body see through
Transportation, handmade
And I know it better than most people
I don't trust them anyways
You can't break the law with them
Get some pussy have a calm night
Shooters killing left and right
Working through your worst night
If I get my money right
You know I won't need you
And I tell you, (bitch)
I hope the sack is full up
I'm fuckin', no I'm fucked up
Spend it when I get that
I ain't trying to keep you
Can't keep up a conversation
Can't nobody reach you
Why your eyes well up
Did you call me from a seance
You are from a past life
Hope you're doing well bruh
I been out here head first
Always like the head first
Signal coming in and out
Hope you're doing well bruh
Everybody needs you
Everybody needs you
Ooh nani nani
This feel like a quaalude
No sleep in my body
Ain't no bitch in my body
New beginnings ah
New beginnings wake up
The sun's going down
Time to start your day bruh
Can't keep being late on me
Know you need the money if you gon' survive the
Every night shit
The every day shit
Dropping baby off at home
Before my night shift
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit
Kumbaya shit
Want to see nirvana, don't want to die yeah
Wanna feel that na na though
Can you come by, fuck with me
After my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down and shit
Bummed out and shit, stressed out and shit
That's every day shit
Shut the fuck up I don't want your conversation
Rolling marijuana that's a cheap vacation
My everyday shit, every night shit, my every day shit
Every night shit
All my night, been ready from you all my night
Been waiting on you all my night
All my life, you've been missing all my night
I'll buzz you in just get me know when you outside
Every night fucks every day up
Every day patches the night up
On God you should match it, it's that KO
No white lighters til I fuck my 28th up
In 1998 my family had that Acura, oh
The Legend, kept at least six discs in the changer
Back when Boswell and Percy had it active
Couple bishops in the city building mansions
All the Reverends
Preaching self made millionaire status
When we could only eat at Shoneys on occasion
After 'trina hit I had to transfer campus
Your apartment out in Houston's where I waited
Stayin' with you when I didn't have a address
Fuckin on you when I didn't own a mattress
Working on a way to make it outta Texas
Every night
Drop the baby off at home before my night shift
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit, Kumbaya shit
Want to see nirvana, we don't want to die yeah
Wanna feel that lovin' when you come by
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down
Wanna see me bummed out
Stressed out
Everyday shit
Shut the fuck up I don't want your conversation
Rolling marijuana, that's a cheap vacation
My everyday shit, every night shit
My everyday shit every night shit
When I feel what I feel
Sometimes it's hard to tell you so
You may not be in the mood to learn
What you think you know
There are times when I find
You wanna keep yourself from me
When I don't have the strength
I'm just a mirror of what I see
But at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
If you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, luhh
When you feel what you feel
It's hard for me to understand
So many things have taken place before this love affair began
But if you feel more like I feel
Confusion can give way to doubt
For there are times when I fall short of what I say
What I say I'm all about
But at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, luhh
Tell me what it is
What it is, no need to make believe
Look beyond your world
Try to find, find a place for me
'Cause when you're at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know
Stay at your best, baby (oh oh oh)
Let me know
Round the city
Round the clock
Everybody needs you
No you can't make everybody equal
Although you got beaucoup family
You don't even got nobody being honest with you

That's a pretty big trunk on my Lincoln town car, ain't it?
Big enough to take these broken hearts and put 'em in it
Now I'm driving 'round on the boulevard, trunk bleeding
And every time the cops pull me over, they never see them
And I've got this black suit on
Roaming around like I'm ready for a funeral
Five more miles 'til the road runs out
I'm about to drive in the ocean
I'ma try to swim from something bigger than me
Kick off my shoes and swim good, and swim good
Take off this suit and swim good, and swim good, good
Got some pretty good beats on this 808 CD, yeah
Memory seats I'm sitting on stay heated
I woulda put tints on my windows but what's the difference
If I feel like a Ghost, no Swayze, ever since I lost my baby
I've had this black suit on
Roaming around like I'm ready for a funeral
One more mile 'til the road runs out
I'm about to drive in the ocean
I'ma try to swim from something bigger than me
Kick off my shoes and swim good, and swim good
Take off this suit and swim good, and swim good, good
I'm going off, don't try stopping me
I'm going off, don't try saving
No flares, no vest, and no fear
Waves are washing me (out)
I'm about to drive in the ocean
I'ma try to swim from something bigger than me
Kick off my shoes and swim good, and swim good
Take off this suit and swim good, and swim good, good
Don't die

I took a walk with the palm trees as the daylight fell
Sangria in a canteen
Talking to myself
This tattoo on my left hand
Is turning purple-ish blue
Daydreams of the romance
Daydreams of you
My pretty woman in a ballgown
I'm Richard Gere in a tux
Getting married in a courthouse
Writing vows in a rush
Making out before the judge
With my teenage wife
Got a wedding band done
That I just might die with
It's an American wedding
They don't mean too much
But we were so in love
We had an American wedding
Now what's mine is yours
That's American law
M-r- s dot Kennedy
She signed her name in pen
In a fancy fancy cursive
Then turned her term papers in
A thesis on Islamic virgin brides and arranged marriage
Hijabs and polygamist husbands
Those poor unamerican girls
After school she ran to me
Jumped in my 5.0
This is the home of the brave
Land of the free
But your parents still didn't know
She said I've had a hell of a summer
So baby
Don't take this hard
But maybe we should get an annulment
Before this goes way to far
It's just an American wedding
They don't mean too much
They don't last enough
We had an American wedding
Now what's mine is yours
American divorce
Oh, oh, oh, girl you blow my mind
Every time that we're alone!
Girl, let's do some new,

If a tree fell in the forest,
And no one was around to hear it,
Baby, does it go 'boom'? Does it go 'boom'?
If I have love for ya,
But you weren't ever close enough to feel it..
Is my love any good? (x2)
Ohh...
But the distance aint even a room away
You're laying in the bed right next to me,
Oh but there might as well be a brick wall in between us,
Some soundproof glass and some bars in the middle...
Oh baby when I wanna talk to you,
I'm conversing with bricks and steel,
A pile of bricks and steel..
And when I tap your shoulders,
You're cold as bricks and steel,
A pile of bricks and steel..
And how do I stay in love with your rubbish

Was it ever real..If you were never here..
Bricks and steel, walk around the kitchen,
Like a pile of bricks and steel..
Bricks bricks, steel steel..
Oh I know you're somewhere in there..
Sometimes I wanna pick up a hammer
And start chiseling away,away..
Chiseling away.. away..

The rate is sky high when I call ya..
But you only let it ring..
You only let it ring no ohh...
But the distance aint even normal aayeee..
You're laying in the bed right next to me,
Oh but there might as well be a brick wall in between us,

A pile of bricks and steel..
And when I tap your shoulders,
You're cold as bricks and steel,

Bricks bricks, steel steel..
Stop, stop ,I think I hear 'em coming down the hall,

All your best interests are on my heart

The young and wild take the spaceships
seeing observations
Searching for the world
Out of delusion

When I was younger I used to wonder like
If I was singing songs, just to sing the songs
Or if was singing cause that's what the bitches wanted
I couldn't play guitar like Van Halen
Had no secret chords like Saint David
But you still came around, ate your lunch with me
Used to park your car to try to bus with me
But I would say girl don't be dumb, I'm riding shotgun
We could go to my house after school after school, after school
Cause my dad don't clock off 'til late, off 'til late, off 'til late
We could kick it in the living room
Looking through my whole vinyl collection
And you could teach me how to slow dance or something
And I'mma give you chills harmonizing to Otis, Isley, Marvin
And everytime somebody asked me
If I sing songs to get at women, I say yeah
They say no fair no fair that's cheating
I say shit, oh well, oh well
And everytime a nigga asks me
If I sing songs to get at women, I say yeah
They say no fair, no fair that's cheating
I say boy don't judge cause hell if you were me
You'd be singin' to her, like lah dah dah dah
Now I'm in the lab, always working late
Always sleeping past, the breakfast she makes
She used to stop by, come and holla at me
Put her purse down and try to battle rap me
She don't do that no more, no more, no more
Don't even listen to the songs I record
But she be banging that Drake in my car
I'm so far gone, she stay blasting Trey and his songs
All damn day long, it's like she never heard of me
A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain
In Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but boy they pour
when im thinking 'bout you
(Ooh, no, no, no)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
(You know, know, know)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh)
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh)
No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool
Enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kissed you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it though
I'm lying down
Thinkin' 'bout you
(Ooh, no, no, no)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
(You know, know, know)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' 'about forever (Oooh)
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' 'about forever (Oooh)
Yes, of course
I remember, how could I forget?
How you feel?
You know, you were my first time
A new feel
It won't ever get old, not in my soul not in
my spirit, keep it alive
We'll go down this road
'Til it turns from color to black and white
Or do you not think so far ahead? (Ahead)
'Cause I been thinkin' 'about forever (Oooh)
Or do you not think so far ahead? (Ahead)
'Cause I been thinkin' 'about forever (Oooh)

I believe Jehovah Jireh
I believe there's heaven, I believe in war
I believe a woman's temple
Gives her the right to choose but baby don't abort
I believe that marriage isn't
Between a man and woman but between love and love
And I believe you when you say that you've lost all faith
But you must believe in something, something, something
You gotta believe in something, something, something
I still believe in man
A wise one asked me why
Cause I just don't believe we're wicked
I know that we sin but I do believe we try
We all try, the girls try, the boys try
Women try, men try, you and I try, try, we all try
I don't believe in time travel
I don't believe our nation's flag is on the moon
I don't believe our lives are simple
And I don't believe they're short, this is interlude
I don't believe my hands are cleanly
Can't believe that you would let me touch your heart
She didn't believe me when I said that I lost my faith
You must believe in something, something, something
You gotta believe in something, something, something
I still believe in man
A wise one asked me why
Cause I just don't believe we're wicked
I know that we sin but I do believe we try
We all try, the girls try, the boys try
Women try, men try, you and I try, try, we all try
she sayin bitch im paid that's all i gotta say
im like who knew (who knew, who knew)
that after all the years i'd make a Weezy fan out of you too (you too, you too)

my girl found it in the car and said baby why you tryna diss me (diss me, diss me)
you know you're my bay, you know you're my bayybee
i'm not just in it for the ride, in it for the ride
She's the prettiest girl I've ever seen on a skateboard
And I'm just a guy with a couple of open ears for her
She told me every story behind all of her tattoos
She's thinking maybe the next one,
Should have something to do with you,
To do with me..
Ohh oohhh.. ohhh okay well you gotta do mine in color...
Ohh oohhh.. ohhh...Cause all of your exes are in black and white..
You wanna get blasted, yeah

And now we getting blasted.. uhh..

My feelings go deeper than the ink,
It goes deeper, deep in to your soul
She said you should get a rubix cube over your heart ohhh yeah
But you say I've already figured it out ,
Already figured out the love...
She want me to get a spaceship tatted inside of my lip oohhh ohh..
Cause that's what she feel like she on when we,
On each other,

Taking these pictures and blowing me kisses
When I ask her to hold my hand,

Told me take that ink like a man (x2)
She told me that (yeah) (x2)
You wanna get blasted, (blasted)
Cause you know this love is gonna last,
And now we getting blasted (blasted)

Who's that talking in the library?
Who's that talking in my library?
Is that you? No I won't put you out
Cause what would this place be without my muse
Nothing special, every book in here I wrote
Some I'm not too proud of some I wish I could burn
So many pages I wrote, wish I could revise them
But there's no erasing and the best advice I got
Was keep writing, and keep living, and keep loving
And when the ink dries and the pages turn to dust
So will we turn to dust, so will we dust, dust
Who's that laughing in my library?
Who's that laughing in my library?
Is that you? No I won't put you out
Cause what would this place be without your smile
Nothing special, I fell in love with you girl
You let yourself inside with no respect for privacy
You said there's too much on my mind
Then you ripped out a page and set that shit on flame
I quit writing, I kept living, I kept loving
And when the ink dries and the pages turn to dust
So will we turn to dust, so will we dust, dust
I'm running from the man.

When we were kids, we hand painted strawberries on a swing
Every moment was so precious, then
I'm still kicking it, I'm daydreaming on a strawberry swing
The entire Earth is fighting, all the world is at its end
Just in case, an atom bomb, comes falling on my lawn
I should say and you should hear I've loved
I've loved the good times here, I've loved our good times here
Say hello, then say farewell to the places you know
We are all mortals, aren't we? Any moment this could go
Cry, cry, cry, even though that won't change a thing
But you should know, you should hear, that I have loved
I have loved the good times here, and I will miss our good times
Spaceships are lifting off of a dying world
And millions are left behind while the sky burns
There wasn't room for you and I, only you, goodbye, goodbye
There will be tears
I've no doubt
There may be smiles
But a few
And when those tears
Have run out
You will be numb and blue
I can't be there with you
But I can dream
I can't be there with you
But I can dream
I can't be there with you
But I can dream
I can't be there with you
But I can dream
I can't be there with you
But I can dream
I can't be there with you
But I can dream
I still dream dream dream
I still dream
My grandaddy was a player
Pretty boy in a pair of gators
See I met him later on
Think it was 1991
The only dad I'd ever know
But pretty soon he'd be gone too
Hide my face hide my face
Can't let em see me crying
'Cause these boys didn't have no fathers neither
And they weren't crying
My friend said it wasn't so bad
You can't miss what you ain't had
Well I can
I'm sad and there will be tears
I've no doubt
There may be smiles
But a few
And when those tears
Have run out
You will be numb
And blue
I can't be there
That's all you had to say to me was
You couldn't be there
Why couldn't you say to me
You won't be there
You could've warned me
You wouldn't be here
Right here
You wouldn't be here for me
sad he never takes her no where
and she always in these rooms
She was more than just a phone call
She says she's really in the mood.
Don't you move 'cause I'm coming
Girl tell him don't bother
Cause baby I'm rushin to you
Don't you move.
Chorus:

Baby
I've been meaning to fuck you in the garden
Breathing so hard, we both could use the oxygen
Just hop on my back, I'll take you down the stairs
Into my backyard and lay you on the grass
[Chorus]
Give it you over again, over again over again
Over again over again, over again over again
Making love, underneath the cherry leaves
Baby girl, tell me how my nature feels
Said oh baby, up against the cherry tree
Baby girl, I'll give it to you naturally, naturally
Feeling like Adam when he first found out this existed
Me and my Eve trying out our first positions
And it's all good, and it's all free, and it's all you, and it's only me
Playing in the dirt wrestling myself inside you
[Chorus]
I think I started somethin', I got what I wanted
Did didn't I can't feel nothin', superhuman
Even when I'm fuckin' Viagra poppin', every single record autotunin'
Zero emotion, muted emotion, pitch corrected, computed emotion
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile
Stripper booty and a rack like wow, Brain like Berkeley
Met her at Coachella, I went to see Jigga, she went to see Z Trip, perfect
I took a seat on the ice cold lawn, she handed me a ice blue bong, whatever
She said she wanna be a dentist really badly, she's in school payin'
For tuition doin' porn in the Valley, at least you workin'
But girl I can't feel my face, what are we smokin' anyway
She said don't let the high go to waste, but can you taste a little taste of
Novocaine, baby, baby, Novocaine, baby, I want you
Fuck me good, fuck me long, fuck me numb
Love me now, when I'm gone, love me none
Love me none, love me none, numb, numb, numb, numb
Sink full of dishes pacin' in the kitchen, cocaine for breakfast, yikes
Bed full of women, flip on a tripod, little red light on shootin', I'm feelin' like
Stanley Kubrick, this is some visionary shit
Been tryna film pleasure with my eyes wide shut but it keeps on movin'
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile
Stripper booty with the rack like wow, I'll never forget ya
You put me on a feelin' I never had, never had, never had
And ever since I've been tryna get it back, pick it up and put it back
Now I'm somethin' like the chemist on campus
But there's no drug around, quite like what I found in you
I still can't feel my face, what am I smokin' anyway
She said don't let the high go to waste but can you taste a little taste of
Novocaine, baby, baby, Novocaine, baby, I want you
Fuck me good, fuck me long, fuck me numb
Love me now, when I'm gone, love me none
Love me none, love me none, numb, numb, numb, numb
Novocaine for the pain
Pretty girls involved with me
Makin' pretty love to me pretty, pity pity
All the pretty girls involved with me
Makin' pretty love to me pretty, pity pity
I can't feel a thing
I can't feel her
Novocaine for the pain
La da da da daaaa (Okay...cause it never felt like that)
La da da da daaaa ( uh uh... its like)
Ohh (Every touch.. every kiss...static baby)
Ohhh (hahah..yeah)
Baby I don't really know which way to go
Its like your energy calling
I-I-I'm bout lose my self composure
Cause the sex has got me buggin,
And you, you look so good i wish you would (Give me what I'm looking for)

When I feel what I feel
Sometimes it's hard to tell you so
You may not be in the mood to learn
What you think you know
There are times when I find
You wanna keep yourself from me
When I don't have the strength
I'm just a mirror of what I see
But at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
If you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, luhh
When you feel what you feel
It's hard for me to understand
So many things have taken place before this love affair began
But if you feel more like I feel
Confusion can give way to doubt
For there are times when I fall short of what I say
What I say I'm all about
But at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, luhh
Tell me what it is
What it is, no need to make believe
Look beyond your world
Try to find, find a place for me
'Cause when you're at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know
Stay at your best, baby (oh oh oh)
Let me know

BASEDGOD WAS RIGHT. we're all a bunch of golden million dollar babies. my hope is that the babies born these days will inherit less of the bullshit than we did. anyhow, what i'm about to post is for anyone who cares to read. it was intended to fill the thank you's section in my album credits, but with all the rumors going round.. I figured it'd be good to clarify...
Whoever you are. Wherever you are... I'm starting to think we're a lot alike. Human beings spinning on blackness. All wanting to be seen, touched, heard, paid attention to. My loved ones are everything to me here. In the last year or 3 I've screamed at my creator, screamed at clouds in the sky, for some explanation. Mercy maybe. For peace of mind to rain like manna somehow. 4 summers ago, I met somebody. I was 19 years old. He was too. We spent that summer, and the summer after, together. Everyday almost. And on the days we were together, time would glide. Most of the day I'd see him, and his smile. I'd hear his conversation and his silence...until it was time to sleep. Sleep I would often share with him. By the time I realized I was in love, it was malignant. It was hopeless. There was no escaping, no negotiating with the feeling. No choice. It was my first love, it changed my life. Back then, my mind would wander to the women I had been with, the ones I cared for and thought I was in love with. I reminisced about the sentimental songs I enjoyed when I was a teenager.. The ones I played when I experienced a girlfriend for the first time. I realised they were written in a language I did not yet speak. I realised too much, too quickly. Imagine being thrown from a plane. I wasn't in a plane though. I was in a Nissan Maxima, the same car I packed up with bags and drove to Los Angeles in. I sat there and told my friend how I felt. I wept as the words left my mouth. I grieved for them, knowing I could never take them back for myself. He patted my back. He said kind things. He did his best, but he wouldn't admit the same. He had to go back inside soon, it was late and his girlfriend was waiting for him upstairs. He wouldn't tell the truth about his feelings for me for another 3 years. I felt like I'd only imagined reciprocity for years. Now imagine being thrown from a cliff. No, I wasn't on a cliff. I was still in my car telling myself it was gonna be fine and to take deep breaths. I took the breaths and carried on. I kept up a peculiar friendship with him because I couldn't imagine keeping up my life without him. I struggled to master myself and my emotions. I wasn't always successful
The dance went on.. I kept the rhythm for several summers after. It's winter now. I'm typing this on a plane back to Los Angeles from New Orleans. I flew home for another marred Christmas. I have a windowseat. It's December 27, 2011. By now I've written two albums. This being the second. I wrote to keep myself busy and sane. I wanted to create worlds that were rosier than mine. I tried to channel overwhelming emotions. I'm surprised at how far all of it has taken me. Before writing this I'd told some people my story. I'm sure these people kept me alive, kept me safe. Sincerely, these are the folks I wanna thank from the floor of my heart. Everyone of you knows who you are.. Great humans, probably angels. I don't know what happens now, and that's alrite. I don't have any secrets I need kept anymore. There's probably some small shit still, but you know what I mean. I was never alone, as much as it felt like it. As much as I still do sometimes. I never was. I don't think I ever could be. Thanks. To my first love, I'm grateful for you. Grateful that even though it wasn't what I hoped for and even though it was never enough, it was. Some things never are.. and we were. I won't forget you. I won't forget the summer. I'll remember who I was when I met you. I'll remember who you were and how we've both changed and stayed the same. I've never had more respect for life and living than I have right now. Maybe it takes a near death experience to feel alive. Thanks. To my mother. You raised me strong. I know I'm only brave because you were first. So thank you. All of you. For everything good. I feel like a free man. If I listen closely.. I can hear the sky falling too
-Frank
I memorized the wayward expressions
Never look down
Never let you see me down
I memorized the way no directions
Can I come over now
I'd like to stay a little while
I memorized your body exposed
I could fuck you all night long
From a memory alone
I never forget a face
Don't go plastic on me
Nothing's set in stone
You're not dipped in gold
Dipped in gold
You can't breathe if you're dipped in gold
You are not on paper
You are not a copy
You're so, you're so..so thick, so thick
Set the cheetahs on the loose
There's a thief out on the move
Underneath our legion's view
They have taken Cleopatra
Run run run, come back for my glory
Bring her back to me
Run run run, the crown of our pharaoh
The throne of our queen is empty
We'll run to the future, shining like diamonds
In a rocky world, rocky rocky world
Our skin like bronze and our hair like cashmere
As we march to rhythm on the palace floor
Chandeliers inside the pyramid, tremble from the force
Cymbals crash inside the pyramid, voices fill up the halls
Set the cheetahs on the loose
There's a thief out on the move
Underneath our legion's view
They have taken Cleopatra, Cleopatra
The jewel of Africa
What good is a jewel that ain't still precious?
How could you run off on me? How could you run off on us?
You feel like God inside that gold
I found you laying down with Samson and his full head of hair
Found my black queen Cleopatra, bad dreams, Cleopatra
Remove her, send the cheetahs to the tomb
Our war is over, our queen has met her doom
No more she lives no more serpent in her room
No more it has killed Cleopatra, Cleopatra
Big sun coming strong through the motel blinds
Wake up to your girl for now, let's call her Cleopatra
I watch you fix your hair
Then put your panties on in the mirror, Cleopatra
Then your lipstick, Cleopatra
Then your six-inch heels
Catch her
She's headed to the pyramid
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Pimping in my convos
Bubbles in my champagne
Let it be some jazz playing
Top floor motel suite twisting my cigars
Floor model TV with the VCR
Got rubies in my damn chain
Whip ain't got no gas tank
But it still got wood grain
Got your girl working for me
Hit the strip and my bills paid
That keep my bills paid
Hit the strip and my bills paid
Keep a nigga bills paid
She's working at the pyramid tonight
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
You showed up after work I'm bathing your body
Touch you in places only I know
You're wet and you're warm just like our bathwater
Can we make love before you go
The way you say my name makes me feel like
I'm that nigga
But I'm still unemployed
You say it's big but you take it
Ride cowgirl
But your love ain't free no more
But your love ain't free no more
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
My flag is American, but I love some Queen
I'm young enough to vote, and toke the trees
I'll be playing concerts in the mud, until the sequel
I'll be finding subjects to paint in the buff, behind the easel
Tryna fuck, I'm a bad boy
I'm a punk, I'm a black man, I could dunk
And I'm hanging low, and swinging for
Home, home
What you say
You need a hero
Heard 'em say
You need say
How high, tell me how high shall we jump
How far, really how far have we come
I've been wondering if we'd be better off without it
I was wondering were we better off before
